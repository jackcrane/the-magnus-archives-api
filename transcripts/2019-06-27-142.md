##### [INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, SOMEWHERE]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON.]

##### [There's a clock ticking steadily in the background throughout.]

#### MARTIN

Uh,uh, right, so...? W,What happened?

##### [The voice of the person to whom he's addressing this question is feminine, in the mid-tones. They clearly are a bit... apprehensive in coming to the Institute.]

#### STATEMENT GIVER

I don't know, a -- Look, I-I just need to, to talk to a manager, or something?

#### MARTIN

Okay, uh, well, uh, yeah, actually; I'm a -- I'm a manager. Go on.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Okay, well... _(sigh)_ I'd like to -- to talk to you about one of your staff.

#### MARTIN

_(slowly)_ Go on...

#### STATEMENT GIVER

There's, uh, there's been... I'm being harassed.

#### MARTIN

O-kay, um. Just, uh, just let me grab a form. Uh... one second.

##### [He flips through some pages over the following:]

#### MARTIN (CONT'D)

Oh, okay, okay, um... What -- Would you mind telling me what happened? Uh, what they did?

#### STATEMENT GIVER

He.

##### [Martin sighs.]

#### MARTIN

Did he look like he hadn't slept in about a week?

##### [Before he even finishes his sentence, the about-to-be statement giver *mhm*s.]

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Yep, uh,

#### MARTIN

_(overlapping)_ Right.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

He's been... Yeah, I think he's been, eh... following me? Kind of.

#### MARTIN

Yeah, I see. Well -- he's not here at the moment, so, I mean -- _(inhale)_ why don't you tell me what happened?

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Look, _(sigh)_ I dunno... I-It's just kind of *weird.*

#### MARTIN

Well... _(small laugh)_ Y'know, uh, weird is what we do.

##### [The statement giver laughs as well. It's awkward, and more than a little out of nerves.]

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Okay...

#### MARTIN

Just -- Just tell me what happened. Please. Um. I -- I won't judge.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Alright. Uh -- So, you -- _(she sighs)_ You've, uh -- You've got to understand my job, okay? Uh, I work for Thames Water? Uh -- mainly pipes and stuff -- like, I -- I mean, I'm a qualified engineer, but you know, most places it's just manual stuff, like digging, and replacing pipe -- Sometimes I've got to -- You know, there are actual sewers involved. _(faster)_ It's not really _[unintelligible]_ myself enough, you know? Yeah, but who does. We don't all get to build Formula 1 engines. Anyway. Look, it's fine. I actually get paid quite a bit more than the rest of the crew, because, you know, if there's, if there's something that goes *wrong*, or needs an engineer, here I am!

Sorry. Um. The point is that I, I work underground. *Did* some work underground. _(explosive sigh)_ Look, I know -- I know this doesn't have anything to do with -- just -- _(shaky inhale)_ About five years ago, we were doin' some work under Kentish Town. It was pretty nasty. Do you know what a fatberg is? No -- uh -- it -- Don't worry; *Don't* look it up -- Seriously, *don't.* You know? It was just -- It was a bad job. They had to spend a whole while down there l -, and now I don't know if -- there was something with us, and, and the work we were doing -- Or maybe just the brickwork wasn't right anymore; maybe it was rotten, or, or unstable, or -- or the place -- well, the place kinda collapsed on me.

You know? It's just -- one moment I'm stood there, torch in hand, and the next I've got a shooting pain all up my arm, and I can feel god knows how much rubble on top of me, and it's absolutely pitch dark, I mean --

Yeah. _(short, manic laugh)_ I don't need to tell you it, look -- I've -- I've never been so scared; it was like -- the world went away. Must have been a full five seconds I thought I was dead.

Excuse me.

#### MARTIN

It's alright. Just -- take your time.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Yeah. _(shaky breath)_ Yeah.

Well... I don't know how long I was down there. Well -- Well, I do. It was... three hours. They told me. After. But it felt like... God, it felt like it could have been weeks. I never had a, a great sense of time, and just... gone. Everything. Every bit of light or sound or anything, that changed, that said time was passing. There was nothing.

Before that, I,I never really thought about time, you know? But now... yeah. But I was lying there, panicking, screaming, just trying to make any noise, any movement, that didn't hurt like *hell.* And I -- Okay. I felt something. No, I felt some*one* grab my ankle.

At first it was great; I had this, this huge wave of relief, right? Someone had found me; they were getting me *out.*

It wasn't. It was cold, right? Like -- like old stone? Or, or wet sand. It felt like -- rough and, and, like the fingers weren't -- I don't know, they felt like they weren't in the right places? And then I started thinking, and -- I realized something -- the way, it was, it was grabbing me, holding my leg, there was -- _(big inhale, shudder)_ It *had* to have been coming upwards. From *below* me. And there was no one else down there when that tunnel collapsed. Absolutely no one. I'm sure.

So then... I start screaming again. And kicking, thrashing about. It hurts, but -- I mean, I'm scared out of my mind, but th-the hand, it just grips, tighter, and I can feel its f,fingernails, just -- I,It -- It started *pulling.* Just pulling down, dragging me down into the earth, and -- yeah, it -- The -- I, I don't know, just -- this close to *breaking*, just absolutely *shattering*, and -- and then a slab of stone came away in front of me, and there was daylight, and Abby -- one, one of the work crew, was staring at me, and, and yeah.

Just like that, it was -- gone.

But the bruise stuck around. Horrid, muddy bruises where the fingers had grabbed me.

So. It-It took a long time to get over that. I mean -- That's not weird, right? I mean, it was a bad time, you know -- it stays with you. I signed off, what, probably about six months, with the injuries? I had really bad, uh, nightmares. Claustrophobia, I mean, obviously, right? But, uh, but I did my physio, you know, talked wi -- with the counselor they gave me. Look, I did everything I was supposed to, and, and yeah, I -- I guess I was fine. You know, once the bruises were gone -- well, I mean, it's easy to blame memory, right? _(she laughs, nervously)_ You know, hallucination, all the -- classic shite you tell yourself. Look, life went back to normal, I -- I was fine. Until -- about two weeks ago.

#### MARTIN

And that was when you met J -- Wh -- uh, one of our employees.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

That's when he showed up. Uh -- You know the coffeeshop, uh, just next to _[Pinnacle]_? Uh, th-the nice one. Well, I actually had -- had a date there, you know, cute guy I met online, too sporty, which, _[joke]_ I like, look, it -- it doesn't matter; Anyway -- I get a latte, and, and sit down, waiting for, uh -- Grant? I want to say Grant. Or- Ga-Gareth? Gary? Anyways, look, he's running late, and, and I'm just reading, and there is this... *creep* in the corner- your guy. He just... keeps staring at me, like- oh, *properly* staring, like it is *super* intense. And, and real... weird?

Like he knows me, but I sure as hell do *not* know him. I -- *I* try to ignore him, look, I just -- I just read my book. And everytime I look up -- there he is. Watchin' me. You know, I'm about to say something, you know, like wh -- _(she splutters)_ When in comes Gary -- Gareth -- Gavin -- and suddenly, hey! It's a date. And I really didn't want his first impression of me to be, you know, me yelling at some creeper in the corner, so I just... swapped chairs, so that I've got my back to your... *colleague*, and get on with it.

It didn't really matter, you know, in the end; Gareth was, uh, was a bust, you know; not like -- you know. I mean. He -- he was fine, I guess, but it's just nothing really there between us, you know -- just a nice boring coffee with a kind old man. Took about an hour, and he clearly wasn't feeling it either, so we, you know, we just called it. I mean, I think we actually shook hands, when he left, which, I mean, tells you something, right?

So, look, I'm packing up, all done, and, and I just -- I just sort of turn, you know? Just to check if he's still there -- and he is standing *right* behind me. Like, like a few *inches* from my face? Look, it's *messed* up! And I start to ask him, you know, *what the* *hell,* man, you know, like -? But he just starts talking. Slowly. But real intense. He says he works here, at the -- the Magnus Institution, and I say what even is that, and he says *he wants my story.*

He says he *needs* to hear what happened to me, and I -- I want to tell him to, to go away; I, I wanted to, to *kick* him and run. But -- I -- _(sigh)_ I sit down. And I start to tell him -- everything. About the job, about the collapse, a-about the hand -- And more than I told you, even, and as I do, it -- it's like I'm there again. Like I can *feel it* grab my ankle, I, a,a cold, dead hand, and I just can't stop talking, like I cannot shut up.

#### MARTIN

A-a. Are you alright?

#### STATEMENT GIVER

No! No, I'm not! Of course I'm not -- It felt like -- Like I was throwing up all those feelings again, and I wanted to, to scream, but instead I just *sat* and calmly told him my life story, and he just *watched* me. His eyes, like -- His eyes were li-like *drinking in* every fragment of *my* misery. I *can't* -- It -- _(pause)_ And then it was over. And he looked -- He looked at me like he'd just eaten, like, a *perfectly* cooked steak. You know what he said, he said *"Thank you."* Thank you, just like that, like -- like reliving the worst parts of my whole life were just a bit of a favor that I'd done him.

And then he left, and, and I-I just sat there, and cried for a while. _(sniff)_ That wasn't the end.

#### MARTIN

He -- You've seen him since?

#### STATEMENT GIVER

_(shaky)_ No. Not -- But kinda. I *feel* like I do. I've been -- *dreaming* of that tunnel again. Nightmares. Oh, god -- awful nightmares. Nightmares, where the, where the hand keeps pulling, and I go deeper and deeper and, and deeper into -- _(shaky inhale)_ It takes me places I do *not* want to go. And he's there the whole time, just... *watching* me. Watching me *scream* and *thrash* and -- _(inhales again)_ He's *all eyes.* He's __all eyes.__ _(inhale, less shaky)_ Look. I know that's not -- _(half-hearted laugh)_ That is *my* brain. I'm not blaming him for, for being in my dreams. You know, I guess I can't.

##### [She sniffs again.]

That's absurd, right? It's no -- But I feel like I'm seeing him when I'm awake, as well? I've been- I've been having a lot of problems, since he talked to me -- well, since *I* talked to him. _(she swallows)_ Since I told my story. Th-The claustrophobia? It's back, you know, worse than it ever was, and I can't do my job. I have these, these *screaming* panic attacks every time I try, and -- and what am I supposed to do? It feels like every time I'm even slightly underground, I --

Can't even go into a shop basement anymore without feeling that -- hand. Every time I do, every time I get that -- panic just rising up my throat, I see him.

##### [Something drips in the background.]

#### STATEMENT GIVER (CONT'D)

He's there. Not when I look properly. But just at the edge. The corner of my eye. And he's got -- well, maybe, maybe it's just me; maybe I just -- I met him once, in a coffeeshop, and he was a creep, and it messed me up. But that's enough. Right? That is __enough.__ So, _(exhale)_ So I want to put in a complaint, like, like a *proper* complaint. Look, I don't want to go to the police. I mean, I doubt they would -- They wouldn't even, you know, let me get this far, now would they, but -- _(sniff)_ Sorry. So, thanks, I guess.

#### MARTIN

Okay, um. Alright, well -- _(he clicks a pen, sighs)_

Firstly, I'm re-- I'm really sorry that this happened. Um, in -- in terms of next steps --

#### STATEMENT GIVER

_(overlapping)_ Just -- I just -- I don't know- Y-You know, *talk* to him, I guess? Just tell him, like, like I mean that -- it's *not okay.* You know, right -- I'm not -- I don't *know* what he did, but you know, he can't just go around and well, you know, just keep doing --

#### MARTIN

_(cutting her off, gently)_ Right. I -- I understand.

#### STATEMENT GIVER

*Good!* _(short pause)_ Well -- Y-- I just, I don't want to see him again. *Ever.*

##### [Some rustling and footsteps.]

#### MARTIN

Wait, h-hold on, no, I just need to --

#### STATEMENT GIVER

_(overlapping)_ No! That's it -- That's -- my -- complaint! You know? I, I -- I can't. This place -- I -- I can't be here. I have to --

##### [They open the door.]

#### STATEMENT GIVER

Bye!

#### MARTIN

Uh -- No -- Uh, but you didn't give me your --

##### [The door slams. They're gone.]

##### [Silence.]

#### MARTIN

...name.

##### [He sighs heavily, messes with the form.]

#### MARTIN

What the hell do I do with that? I mean, *christ*, John, that's -- that's not okay! Oh, that ca -- that can't -- _(he cuts himself off)_ I mean, it's not him, is it. Not -- not really. It's -- what, addiction, instinct, maybe m-mind control, something like that? I -- can't believe he'd *choose* to do something like that. No, no, I -- I can't think like that, though, I, I *can't* let myself, because if, if he's already gone, then all of this is just -- _(cuts off again, heavy, weary sigh)_

Th-The worst part of it is I don't even want to talk to him about it. I just -- I suppose I'm just getting comfortable with the distance. Cut off. _(short, humorless laugh)_ *Lonely.* _(inhale)_ Mind you, Peter's not wrong. It really is easier than actually just trying to communicate with people. I should probably try and get him this tape, let him know what happened, that someone came in to -- _(sigh)_

But then, would that just come across as an accusation? Because I don't want to -- and then, then I guess he'd hear this bit as well, so -- I -- it -- I --

What do I do?

##### [The clock ticks on. For a few moments there is silence, and then there is a soft knock at the door.]

##### [Martin inhales.]

#### MARTIN

Go away.

##### [The knocking continues, a little more insistent. Martin sighs.]

#### MARTIN

_(to whoever's outside)_ Come in!

##### [The door opens and Daisy enters.]

#### DAISY

_(soft)_ Hey.

#### MARTIN

_(confused)_ Hi?

#### DAISY

Do you mind?

#### MARTIN

Can -- Can I help you...?

#### DAISY

I -- I saw someone come out, so I -- I thought that, you know.

#### MARTIN

Do -- Do you *want* something?

#### DAISY

Ju-Just ignore me. Continue with -- whatever.

##### [Short pause.]

#### MARTIN

...Are you alright?

#### DAISY

Yeah. Just, uh, a bit empty around here, you know?

#### MARTIN

Not really.

#### DAISY

Melanie's out, and -- _(sigh)_ John and Basira are still off. Bit worried. But they can take care of themselves, you know?

#### MARTIN

_(tight)_ Again, not really. _(short laugh)_ No one really talks to me anymore.

#### DAISY

'Cause they reckon you're working for the bad guy?

#### MARTIN

Pretty much. Don't you?

#### DAISY

Oh, I mean, you're *definitely* working for something evil, but -- so are we.

#### MARTIN

_(inhale)_ Yeah. Seems there's plenty to go around, these days. _(pause)_ It doesn't bother you?

#### DAISY

Didn't use to.

#### MARTIN

And now?

#### DAISY

Bothers me less than trying to go alone. At least -- now it's on my terms, better than being blackmailed into it.

#### MARTIN

_(another humorless laugh)_ Yeah, I *guess.* _(brief pause)_ They told you about Elias, right?

#### DAISY

Yeah. Basira said. Don't like him being alive. Trying not to think about it too much. Don't want to get too angry, start to -- hear the blood.

#### MARTIN

...Sure.

#### DAISY

Can't hear his lies from prison, though, so -- that's something.

#### MARTIN

I thought you believed him. You were doing all of his dirty work.

#### DAISY

Well, wasn't willing to call his bluff. Not the same thing as *believing.* Just too big of a risk.

#### MARTIN

Not for Melanie.

#### DAISY

Well, maybe she was the only one with any sense. Even if he was telling the truth, _(sigh)_ If we all... *died*... there are worse things.

##### [Pause.]

#### MARTIN

How was it?

#### DAISY

Don't wanna talk about it.

#### MARTIN

I listened to your old statement. Wasn't your partner down there?

#### DAISY

Yeah. Didn't find him.

#### MARTIN

You don't want to go get him?

#### DAISY

_(heh)_ I'm not going back.

#### MARTIN

_(vaguely smug)_ Hm, I'd have thought you'd have at least *tried,* or --

#### DAISY

_(overlapping)_ I __said.__ I don't want to talk about it.

#### MARTIN

I know. Not nice being interrogated, is it?

#### DAISY

_(inhale)_ I -- Oh.

#### MARTIN

Yeah.

##### [Pause.]

#### DAISY

I'm sorry, Martin.

#### MARTIN

It's alright. Wasn't you. _(he inhales)_ Not really.

#### DAISY

No, it was. I hate a lot of what I did back then; doesn't mean I'm not responsible for it, doesn't mean it wasn't me.

#### MARTIN

_(exhales)_ Anyway. So what's this field trip they're on?

#### DAISY

They, uh... they didn't tell you?

#### MARTIN

_(ha)_ No, I -- What. Daisy, where have they gone?

#### DAISY

You know that town in Norway?

#### MARTIN

What? I -- Wai -- *What?* You don't mean Ny-__Ålesund__?!

#### DAISY

Yyyyeah. They reckon there's a ritual they need to, you know --

##### [Martin sighs in the background as she speaks.]

#### MARTIN

Yeah, but -- Peter didn't even tell me --

##### [He starts opening and shuffling through drawers.]

#### MARTIN (CONT'D)

I don't believe this!

#### DAISY

Sorry. Shouldn't have said anything.

#### MARTIN

No, no, it's -- thank you; I just -- For god's sake, can he not stay safe for like, like *ten minutes?*

#### DAISY

I don't think that's an option for him anymore.

#### MARTIN

Yeah, I mean, sure -- _(slams a drawer shut)_ -- But he just -- He just doesn't *think.* He always just *immediately* charges straight off into danger with whatever -- whatever half-assed plan occurs to him at the time; I don't *get* it!

#### DAISY

What's to get?

#### MARTIN

What?

#### DAISY

I-I mean, it's pretty standard stuff.

#### MARTIN

__What?__

#### DAISY

_(coughs lightly)_ You used to see it all the time, back in the force, especially with the Sectioned. Not like there's *normal* trauma, you know? But it's pretty common. The most important thing becomes control, engaging on your own terms. Even when it's *stupid* or dangerous. Anything to not feel helpless.

#### MARTIN

Oh, god.

#### DAISY

And of course, for John, there's survivor's guilt in there, too. He thinks he's not human. Makes him very... self-destructive.

#### MARTIN

Yeah, well. We've all had trauma.

#### DAISY

And everyone's changed.

#### MARTIN

Yeah. _(long inhale, exhales as he speaks)_ I suppose. You're -- You're pretty observant, you know.

#### DAISY

Detective, remember?

#### MARTIN

Yeah, you did mention. Would have thought Basira would've had more sense, though.

#### DAISY

When Basira and I were partners, I'd see this happen sometimes. She can read a situation like no one I know, always seems to know the right move, but for all her research, she never wants to put a plan together. I think she just hates all the... unknowns, the... variables. _(sigh)_ Contingencies. If she spots an advantage, she'll grab it, and trust herself to figure out the details as she goes.

#### MARTIN

_(heh)_ Hm.

#### DAISY

It's worked so far.

#### MARTIN

I mean. _(soft exhale)_ I *guess.* Still sounds really dangerous.

#### DAISY

Ye-ah... Wanted to go with them, protect them, but... _(soft shaky breath)_ Life's always more complicated than that, isn't it?

#### MARTIN

Not really.

#### DAISY

_(inhale)_ You recording, or?...

#### MARTIN

Hm? Uh -- Oh -- No, no there was -- hang on --

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
