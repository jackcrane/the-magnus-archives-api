I like to think that Peter's gone off kayaking with Tim now.

#### PETER / ALASDAIR STUART

Yeah.

#### ALEX NEWELL

I also *weirdly* think Peter's an amazing dad to Tim.

#### THE ARCHIVIST / JONNY SIMS

Yeah, but the thing is -- it's kind of awkward, because Peter would much rather be kayaking alone.

#### ALEX NEWELL

Yeah, but Tim's so oblivious he would be there *forever,* and *never* realise.

#### PETER / ALASDAIR STUART

Just accidentally nurturing.

#### THE ARCHIVIST / JONNY SIMS

Just, "Hey Peter! You wanna -- go do this?" "Yes, fine..."

#### PETER / ALASDAIR STUART

_[in-character, resigned]_ "Yes, of course." _[as Tim:]_ "I'm going antiquing." _[as Peter:]_ "Sounds fun!"

Peter Lukas, as the dad, doesn't *like* the son, but still pays for college, all of the clubs, drove him to every single thing, and objectively was actually quite good to be around.
