##### [INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, POST-WATCHER'S CROWN]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON]

##### [The background has a shimmery quality to it, a haunting set of soft organ-like tones, modulating slowly. It is not harmonious, but it is musical. We hear the occasional screech, though whether human or inanimate is unclear. Still, all of it seems *normal,* whatever that means in this new world. It is not commented upon. It is room tone.]

##### [The Archivist sighs deeply. He inhales sharply, and a small creak immediately follows.]

##### [Then he sighs again, and this time, it's more of an exhale.]

#### ARCHIVIST

What? _(Beat)_ What do you want?

##### [Something creaks.]

#### ARCHIVIST _(CONT'D)_

The world is --

##### [Something in the background-- wind? A monster?-- howls, and the Archivist falters for a moment.]

#### ARCHIVIST _(CONT'D)_

It's over. You've *won*.

What can you possibly still need to hear?

##### [His voice dips lower at the end of his sentence. Something creaks, longer this time. The Archivist gasps.]

#### MARTIN

_(knocking)_ Knock, knock!

#### ARCHIVIST

Who's there?

##### [When he speaks, his voice is filled entirely with affection.]

##### [We hear a couple of footsteps as Martin steps into the room.]

#### MARTIN

Just me.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(ah, yes)_ Just me who.

##### [It's phrased less of a question, and more of an inevitability.]

#### MARTIN

What?

#### ARCHIVIST

Never mind.

#### MARTIN

Uh -- okay.

How are you feeling today?

##### [The Archivist inhales deeply.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Define... "today."

#### MARTIN

How are you feeling in general, then.

#### ARCHIVIST

Unchanged. I don't know if it will ever change again.

#### MARTIN

_(trying)_ I brought you some tea.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(immediate)_ No, you didn't.

#### MARTIN

Uh -- what? Y,Yes, I did.

##### [A small nervous chuckle.]

#### ARCHIVIST

We ran out of tea the day before the change; you said the little shop in the village didn't have any more.

##### [Brief pause. Something rattles.]

#### ARCHIVIST _(CONT'D)_

Ergo, _(braced inhale)_ that isn't tea.

##### [Martin begins to splutter and walk closer.]

#### MARTIN

W,What? No, of course it's tea, I --

##### [The rattling flares up, louder; hisses, even. Martin breaks off, begins to yell, increased in volume. He drops the teacup or mug. It shatters.]

##### [We assume the hissing was the tea.]

##### [The *thing* hisses again, quieter, then fades out with a last rattle, leaving or disappearing.]

##### [Martin's yelling subsides.]

#### MARTIN

Wha-What's [bank] -- Alright, I, I *made* that! If, if -- _(heavy breathing, steadying himself)_ I thought you were! --

#### ARCHIVIST

I'm sorry, Martin. _(dry laugh, humorless)_ Things don't work like that anymore.

#### MARTIN

_(indignant)_ Like *what?*

#### ARCHIVIST

Like normal.

##### [A wailing sound- wind or monster?- from the background.]

#### ARCHIVIST _(CONT'D)_

This isn't a world where you can trust --

#### MARTIN

_(spluttering)_ *Tea?*

#### ARCHIVIST

Comfort.

##### [Martin exhales.]

#### MARTIN

Oh. _(brief pause, quieter)_ Yeah. Yeah.

##### [He exhales, softly, and then there's silence for a moment. Something... *warps* in the background.]

#### MARTIN

_(humorless little exhale)_ Maybe I should, uh -- pop down the village? See if they have any coffee instead?

#### ARCHIVIST

It's gone, Martin, and the *people* are --

#### MARTIN

Yes, I know, John; I'm not ignorant, I'm just -- I'm just not ready for *complete* despair yet.

#### ARCHIVIST

Like me.

#### MARTIN

I didn't *say* that.

#### ARCHIVIST

You didn't have to.

##### [Silence. The warping wind is back, in the background, with a few other not-quite-natural not-quite-unearthly sounds layered over it.]

#### MARTIN

You *know* I'm here for you.

##### [The Archivist inhales, long and deep, then exhales.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Yes.

##### [Clothes rustling. Possibly a hug, at the very least drawing closer to Martin.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Yes I do.

#### MARTIN

Alright. Alright.

#### ARCHIVIST

Thank you.

#### MARTIN

You still... _(sigh)_ Feeling it, seeing everything?

#### ARCHIVIST

_(nearly a whisper)_ Yes. I, I'm trying not to, but -- all the fear, the anguish, i-it just keeps coming at me in waves, rolling over me, filling my head with such *awful* sights.

#### MARTIN

I'm sorry. That sounds... _(small sigh)_ That sounds horrible.

#### ARCHIVIST

I wish it was, Martin. I *really* wish it was.

##### [Something creaks.]

#### ARCHIVIST

But it feels... right.

##### [He exhales, a breathy *huh.*]

##### [Something creaks.]

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
