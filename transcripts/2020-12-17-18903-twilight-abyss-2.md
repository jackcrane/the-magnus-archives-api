[Music]
hello
it's still johnny and welcome back to
the
second part of the magnus season five
second hiatus gaming podcast
episode two
nailed it i am joined johnny having a
nice normal one over there
i am i i i have nothing but normal ones
uh
i am normal ones through and through
uh joining me just then was the voice of
ben meredith
hello uh hello ben i was just myself
last time so you should listen to the
first episode of this
sub art yeah i'll just honestly if you
haven't listened to the first episode of
of this
three-part bit of hiatus nonsense
this is high quality content johnny i do
it
no i'm not saying i'm not saying that
like obviously they should listen
because people
are having a good time it's triple
distilled nonsense though you know
yeah but they should show up but they
should
listen to the first one first yeah
because otherwise
you know it might be an interesting
experiment to listen to the second one
and then go back i don't know
this is this is the future johnny the
youth into remix culture
they're gonna be using and sampling
and um
all sorts of answers they're gonna
sample me saying i'm having a normal one
yeah well for you crazy cats out there
who
started listening to episode two um we
also do podcasts called rust core gaming
and stella firma go listen to those
god damn it ben desperately wants you
to to listen to his other his other
creations
where he does he does other voices it's
not just
a sexy boss yeah i'm a sexy dwarf i'm a
sexy goblin i'm a sexy clone
it's great sexy archaeologist at one
point right
okay let's leave ben's let's leave ben's
raw
unfiltered sexuality and eroticism
behind just a moment
i guess to make sure that our listeners
do know the other speakers so who's that
who's that voice
roasting ben me and lori both pause
because it's like
hey everyone rose to ben yeah i'm i'm
lydia nicholas
i'm melanie in magnus
and also in rustica gaming with you're
not melanie
in practical gaming no i'm other other
characters
could be this we've given this company's
naming conventions yes
true miss pledges first name is actually
sasha
yes it is canon such a pledge that's a
good name
speaking of hello who are you i'm laurie
and i produce the magnus archives and i
do a vocal cut
editing for rusty quill gaming and i
listen to stella firma
so that means you should just listen to
them all and i am also with sasha
right so when last we left we were at
slide world a water park this adventure
has had the random title generated of
before the twilight of the blind abyss
and uh health inspector gavin crumble
himbo lifeguard
freddie and uh park caretaker ms pledge
uh were all about to descend down into
the pump room
to well basically to help to help gavin
uh just do some checks some very normal
checks
on the very normal water in this park
on the very normal opaque water of the
very normal ride
helpful the the helpful is it's it's
fine it's you know
it's just it's just good clean fun it's
very clean i clean it daily
yeah just by pouring bleach in there
i like yeah and there's like i mean
there's at most one bone a day
yeah you know they erode eventually all
the bleach
does that i don't know where like what
level of canonicity
these mumbles have just that you kind of
pour lime
into a particular like tray
put that in and then be like there's no
bones clogging the outlet now
there are occasional like you you do
sometimes find bones in the hell full
but it's it's fine it's very it's i mean
it's not
very rare but it's it's it hasn't
happened today
yeah there's some open stretches so
animals could get in
overnight yeah like obviously it's
generally like
you assume it's animal bones yeah like
deer wolves
big big big dogs yeah yeah maybe
a cow yep some some sort of some sort of
bonobo
yeah well this is in this is in dorset
so we're right next to monkey world
and once we have a tank driving ah i i'm
from
dorset and i i've i love monkey world
monkey world's amazing i was talking
about monkey world yesterday that's so
weird
it's a great day out mate it's a great
day out go go to monkey world
everyone obviously this doesn't apply to
like
americans don't fly internationally no i
do then travel to dorset specifically to
go to monkey world because i think you
will be a little bit disappointed
but if you're in the south of england
and you are also in
a beautiful future uh where you can go
outside
go to monkey world it's great cool and
yes it is right next to the tank museum
which is uh
and in this universe also right next to
and also right next to slidewell slide
world yeah that's in
in this this is a parallel universe very
similar to our own
they call it the triangle of fun
yeah you never see them they say
dorset's triangle of fun you'll never
want to leave
anyway you're still standing at the top
of these stairs so
i don't want to um this is obviously
your facility but it looks like that is
a
that is a lock that needs a key not a
not a swipe card
no it's been opened mr casper opened it
for you oh thanks mr cat yes i forgot
about him he just watched he just slides
off the mountain i'm already gone though
oh yes um mr casper is a very uh
observant
and uh helpful uh boss you'll often just
turn up
uh with very little warning um just when
you need him
uh or just when you're about to like go
through a door that says keep out
or sometimes when it's just dark uh so
he very
much uh sees the safety of the workforce
oh obviously first after the safety of
uh the park
uh guests there's there's a lot of
safety yeah mr calcifer
carries in his head that and the safety
of the water thank you
both the safety of us at the safety of
the guests
i would rather look at the machines
instead of hearing the sales pitch
also as freddie goes down the stairs uh
also the safety of the food
in the in the caf uh he also oversees
the safety
of that i am a very water safety
inspector
the food safety inspector
in the cafe oh no no so
i don't i don't look at potable water oh
right
i see and um i i really do hope that you
do not stock your swimming pools with
potable water um because that will have
bacteria you don't just pour tap water
into
the swimming pools do you freddie i
don't know
so someone so someone does oh that's not
my job so
are you on record of saying someone just
pours tap water into
the pool you've reached the bottom of
the stairs congratulations as far as i
know there's
not a record play what um
right yes gavin crumble makes a note
so freddie is terrified you arrive bum
the stairs it is a
large room with eight big
pumping machines like a very strong
chemical bleach smell the helpful slide
doesn't get pumped through from this
room it has its own separate room
down a narrow kind of you know
it's in slight disrepair like a lot of
cobwebs some like
weird stains just like down a long
narrow corridor
off to one side so uh this is the pumps
you can see there are eight
uh we have uh eight rides as you saw the
flutter buys
uh with uh the the little ones um there
was also
uh another one which i mentioned um i
think
you would quite like
the log flume which uh as i've said is
very safe you can walk along
uh should you so wish there is also the
the jungle ride the toilet ride
the toilet bowl uh which is not the same
as the jungle ride
i believe this spinning top was one of
them as well the the spinning top
does also do that hold on i'll just go
back a second
i just want to just dial back splashy
splash
uh ask lori could you describe the
toilet bowl water slide absolutely
you very subtly pitched there absolutely
boy
have you ever been on one of those ones
where you go in and it's like a big bowl
and you spin round and round and round
and round around and then it shoots you
out
it's is the gimmick here you're getting
like a really long brown
inflatable that you just got to just lie
down in
that's the ones it's funny that you'd
say that because they weren't originally
brown
just uh from use uh yes gavin crumble
makes a note it's it's just because it's
just because of how the plastic
changes color as it is yeah it's just a
the friction
against the you know the staff the
friction and the uv
yes yes the the jungle ride which takes
advantage of the fact that we are next
to monkey world and
so sometimes you can glimpse the monkeys
over
the the side of the pool which does not
illegally go over the land of
monkey world it does not uh that has
been measured and
checked um also there's a swirly whirly
wall
um there's the whirly whirly swirl which
is different
and there is always sorry what's the
last one the shark slide
yes shark slide yeah which contrary to
opinion
does not actually put sharks down the
slide no the sharks are at the bottom
they're in the aquarium yeah the gavin
crumble makes a note
by which i assume you mean that there
are like there's a sort of kind of sub
a slightly dropped level uh with like a
big sort of aquarium style shark tank
like swimming around the edges of the
pool yes
so it feels like you're swimming with
sharks yes but actually there's
some glass between which is probably
it's probably very thick it's probably
very thick they're also
really they they're just dog fish really
yeah it's so it's water park
and shark aquarium
to be fair i think that would be a great
i think that'd be a great pool to be
swimming around like you're swimming and
like
you're kind of swimming with the with
the tiny tiny sharks
yeah tiny sharks are the sharks tiny or
are you giant
yeah who's who can say freddy pokes the
machines
yeah they're working they're fine look
this machine as you can see is working
do you want to make a roll over ben i
will i will i think obviously
at the pumps yeah i'm guessing analytics
is helping me out here uh yeah so can we
just uh
so if i'm applying a benefit what is the
exact
effect of that uh so it'll be lowering
the target number oh okay okay let's see
if something is just targeting this
we'll target on the base
cool uh well i rolled a nine yep that's
great these are like it
everything seems pretty much as you'd
expect it
a few of them could probably do with
having some of the
chlorine chemical levels uh topped up a
bit but they're all within
within acceptable safety standards they
all seem to be working
they're all just rumbling along okay
like you know spend a good 15 minutes
looking around making sure it's all in
order
make a couple of recommendations but no
citations
yeah what a mr pledge what are you doing
while this
investigation is taking place well i'm
tailing
and just if if there's something that
maybe
isn't as it should be i'm
trying to get there i'm using my
knowledge of this room
which is deep to get ahead
of gavin crumble okay to you know maybe
if like oh
tank four we really meant to put
chlorine in that just put a bit
more in before he gets there and you
know a bone oh
chuck it into the tank or you can't in
the filter get rid of that
yeah okay uh make me uh make me a a roll
i think i think you have
you've got resourceful so i'll give you
um i'll say yeah
that is
ten ten nice yeah no yeah uh like
every time uh every time gavin is
looking at one machine
uh miss pledge is just sort of all over
the one immediately opposite
topping things up polishing twisting
it it turns out ben that uh maybe all of
these machines
were not yep doing quite so well
uh before you arrived but and weirdly
like you actually returned
to the uh the twirly world you got
confused you did the whirly 12 twice
uh and so when you return to the twirly
world uh it seems to actually be working
better
the second time okay i do i do that sort
of like
tap on the the valve kind of thing that
people do
just you know uh just to make sure and
then and then i'll remove one of those
citations
it seems to be wonderful so that's yeah
that's what pumps all seem good
so um what about that uh particularly
spooky corridor
oh um well as you see uh the thematic
decorations
extend throughout the uh the part
because uh mr calcifer
is an extremely detail-oriented
uh manager he in fact uh inspects
everything every day uh some of them all
the time
uh he is somehow there whenever you are
looking at it it's extremely impressive
and uh diligent
and so this is the treatment for the the
helpful
which is one of our star attractions
yes the one with the opaque black water
it's uh an extremely scary ride
um i can think of many ways in which i
find it scary
now let's go to the pump room and make
sure it's all in order uh
yes uh mr uh crumble uh sir mister
yes sir will do you head down the long
corridor
your steps seeming to echo that much
more
as you approach the door uh this one
reads
caution helpful pump
secret uh also just a detailed
classified
i am definitely having to center
but i'm definitely gonna have to careful
now
but i'm definitely gonna have to sign mr
calcifer
but i'm definitely gonna have to uh
stoop down this corridor
oh yeah it's it's uh it is uh how tall
do you say you were
six foot five it's six foot four okay
somehow freddie goes ahead of you down
the corridor
and despite being not that much shorter
than mr crumble he doesn't get any
cobwebs in his hair but there are
cobwebs at
face level just all the way as mr
clementine
because miss pledge is dusting them out
of your way
as you go i i see invested in you
looking good
so you both you both come at the end of
it like looking fine i come out looking
like an absolute nightmare i look like
the thing that's left at the back of the
halloween uh display of a store in like
late november
yeah yeah you look like you look like if
someone took a halloween scarecrow
and then just like covered in fake
cobwebs i'm just shaking them off my
clipboard the door is not actually
locked
clearly mr casper felt the sign was was
enough right this way
mr uh mr crumble sir
yeah very good the the pump room for
the uh the hell the hell dive ins is it
the hell dive with the hell full because
it's
it's the hell for except when you
describe it
yeah well i i thought that last episode
i said hell full and you said hell dive
no no what you said he'll dive and then
i tried to
to improv patchwork it by saying that
the hell dive
was the spookiest bit of the hellful
yeah
lydia yes anded she collaborated with
yeah thank you it's a thing people do
johnny no it's shh no
explain myself to you people just know
[Laughter]
anyway so as you enter the the room
containing the pump for the hellfall
it's a square room
with completely blank concrete walls the
pipes come in from the ceiling they're
just
big completely completely close of iron
pipes
and go back out up the ceiling and in
the center
is a black metal box
that is sat there completely silent how
big is the box
it is about say 15 foot by 15 foot
like 15 foot it's like a 15 foot cube
let's see
so um this is the pumping mechanism for
the hellfool
um uh yes uh mr crumble sir
uh they uh it does all the mod cons
of the ride uh keeping it clean
and safe and it
uh what is very modern seeming almost to
draw your eye
extremely modern and safe it manages the
safety of the
rides and uh of the
uh riders right uh well this is
obviously this is a model that i'm i'm
not familiar with
it's very modern it looks sort of like
the monolith in 2001 a space odyssey
is that a cube an old film i am very
young as has been established
that much film is a recorded it is a
recorded medium you can
you can watch it it's um it's quite a
famous stat stanley kubrick have you
heard of the shining clock orange
i don't have much time to uh patiently
uh because i pick things up and put them
down so often
right god the youth today uh right well
how do you open this thing
can i have a look at some of the
readouts if you there's no readouts on
the outside if you have a look
uh there is essentially a hatch on the
side
about halfway up there's a small set of
metal stairs that lead up to a hatch
which sort of lifts
up uh it's about sort of i'd say maybe
five foot up the of the wall like it
lifts it's about
like it's about big enough that if you
wanted to climb inside you could
but you know you'd need to like have a
bit of a squeeze
uh if you would like to inspect the
inside of the the mechanism inside
of the uh of the mechanism here uh
so uh you can see this handy hatch yeah
well i'm not really a mechanical
engineer
i'm just more so all of the readouts are
inside the machine that would make sense
right okay i will walk up and open the
hatch
just to be clear neither ms pledge nor
freddie have ever actually seen this
before but freddie
why died himbo in

essence so are you heading up to the
hatchery yeah i'm gonna i'm expecting to
see
pipes and valves and things okay so
you pull the hatch up
and the inside it's very dark it takes
you you are
a few moments for your eyes to adjust uh
you're still you're still stood outside
the water comes up just
below where uh where the hatch is so
uh from where you're standing you can
see sort of just still
water inside just kind of sitting there
you're not entirely sure
how it would there doesn't seem to be
any machines any mechanism for actually
pumping it back out although you can see
it you know going out
if you look outside the machine at the
pipes like i know i said that they were
completely opaque but i've decided
there's probably a little window where
you can see water going up yeah
yeah the occasional bubble going past
yeah just a little bubble
but as your eyes adjust you can see that
there is there appears to be
a figure standing in the water
um is this some kind of joke
and i'll kind of look to the other they
are tall
and thin and pale and seem to be wearing
some sort of dark apron
they are facing away from you other head
appears to be completely bald
are they moving or like is this
completely still yeah okay
are you calling out well no so i'm i'm
looking at this sort of con confused
and then i turn my head to freddie and
just
blowing with innocence uh i'm sorry is
this some kind of joke like
somebody's put some sort of shot
mannequin in here to try and i don't
know
scare me um i'm not finding this very
amusing at all and i'm going to have to
write this up and i start making a note
in my
way when you turn back uh after having
spoken it has
is moved uh it is now facing towards you
and
you can see it has it has very
rudimentary features
but where it where its eyes would
normally be
two large holes leak this
dark black fluid down into the water
it seems to be looking towards you but
not actually at you
i i will get up abruptly and sort of
using a veneer of anger to cover my
obvious discomfort be like
no this is absolutely unacceptable if
you're just playing some kind of
practice
could i have a role from you yes in case
you potentially take some hit point
damage from the horror
i i think i would actually like to to
maybe ask if bureaucrat is applicable
here because i am using sort of the
the the veneer of process in order to
try and like okay
i'll allow that like i think it is it
would be in a target number of 10 though
that's pretty scary yeah so that'll
lower it back down to an eight
which on a roll of six so that's
unfortunate
so i'm gonna give you two hit points of
fear
okay oh no as you start to talk you can
see that it is
it is walking through the through the
water towards you ripples
lapping away i i back off so
i slammed the hatch down back off and
i'm like
yeah sort of pseudo angrily like
blustering uh
freddie and and miss pledge was a
chemical level
uh incorrect mr crumble circuit
absolutely no need to write anything
down on your notepad no th this is
this is ridiculous it's leaking in there
why would you do that there's some sort
of break the mechanism no you you
go look go look good you're obviously
playing some kind of practical joke this
isn't funny at all where are the cameras
i absolutely will have a chat you have
broken our machine and this will need to
be
uh reported to someone someone uh will
need to know about this
uh you coming in here trying to trying
to mess with mr calcifer
just breaking our equipment uh freddie
will uh go over and be like hello
uh and begin to unscrew just actually
properly remove the hatch not just open
it
oh no open it oh no open it sorry i
thought weirdly like a porthole so you
have to
screw it but anyway no it's it's very
much just like it's got a handle you
just stand uh
okay so it's it's a relatively obvious
mechanism yeah yeah yeah it's
like you know if you imagine the sort of
sort of hatch one might use to
potentially
i don't know throw some meat into a pool
of dark water sure it feeds something
that lurks inside
it's that sort of hatch right sure heavy
strong stop any demonic
stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah just
theoretically that's what it would be
you lift it up
and the face still leaking
that hitch black fluid is about
six inches from yours oh my goodness
there's a person stuck in here
you trapped a person in here why would
this is okay as you start
to to cry out it lunges at you
i think freddie will try and headbutt it
brilliant okay uh i'll i'll probably uh
i'll probably call that
i'll probably call that a himbo roll
then yeah you'll need a six because it's
lunging towards you and it's not yeah
there we go there is a
there's a six that's a six okay just
about
managed to headbutt the demon
so yeah you like it crunches in
and it's like head butting a water
balloon
oh uh like it's kind of yields and it
does stagger backwards
but as it does so your face is covered
in this black fluid uh freddie screams
yep uh you're going to be taking
probably two hit point damage
you find yourself
staring out at an unknowable
huge impossible void distant stars
twinkling as though your face your face
is very cold oh dear
as though it is in the spaces between
galaxies terrible
as you turn towards uh ms pledge
and uh gavin crumble they will see
that where the liquid has splashed on
your face
you can see stars and space
as though freddy's face had become
a hole in the universe
ready boy and then the liquid sort of
flows off and you like
yes freddie is screaming and clawing at
his face
pulling pulling the liquid off as the
liquid goes off
like your face returns oh that's that's
very reassuring i i'm quite keen on my
face
a lot of people are as are many people
i'm gonna
say you probably staggered down the
small staircase
uh while that was happening the thing is
crawling now it's it's
scrolling out of the hole yeah it's like
kind of flopped
out of the hole and is currently getting
itself to its feet
miss pledge is gonna leak forward with
her mop to try and push it back into the
tank
ready boy run very heroic right i would
like to use loyal
yup no that makes absolute sense like
it's gonna be a bit
tricky because this thing is it's it's
very tall and long and like
shoving it back through the hatches is
going to be a little bit tricky
so it would be a 10 that's reduced to an
eight you could also take a devil's
bargain if you wanted to make it a
little bit easier you have to negotiate
a bad consequence
yeah so a devil's bargain is where we
agree
a negative consequence which will happen
regardless of whether you succeed or
fail
okay so you could say well all right but
even if i succeed
this negative consequence happens yeah
and in return
i make the role slightly easier miss
pledge will make the devil's bargain for
freddie
she's very invested in him i guess
losing the mop isn't
enough it's a very good mop she's had it
for all
you know what no you you know what yeah
you you lose the mop
i'll say that you can you can lose the
mop if you lose the mop maybe you also
lose your ability to clean or one of
those things no no no no like it no
it's not that you lose the mop it's that
this thing
regardless of whether or not you succeed
in driving it back into the tank
it will have the mop which
i mean that's probably fine what what
damage could something like this do with
a mob
having a long stick in a horror
situation
right so what am i aiming for six so
you're looking for a six
i got a nine i'm not brilliant yeah you
you just sort of charge forward and
start like
pushing it right you shove the mop into
its face
so that the the very absorbent uh what
are they called like the
muppets you know the tendrils of a mop
the mop tentacles
yeah the mock tentacles start to sort of
soak in uh
this this darkness as you sort of shove
it and just
like you literally are just jabbing it
back through the hole
but it grips them up very tightly and
you can't pull it back
so instead you shove the mop in and slam
down the hatch
what what what is going on you have
broken the machine you have broken mr
calcifer's lovely machine
how could you do something so terrible
there is a scary man inside that machine
that is a piece of what that is
impossible therefore it must be a piece
of equipment
freddy boy i'd heard i'd heard of this
what no no there's a reason yeah
what what what what legends does slide
world have about this
nothing very specific but there have
been rumors
that a bargain was made because you know
slide world was struggling for a while
boy
what and then slide world as always this
was the place where dreams are made
by this before your time i've been
around i'm
well frankly i'm old as balls
it was before freddie's time so like two
years ago you are very mature for your
for your age freddie i could take on a
lot of different tasks
including basic admin but there was a
time
there was a time freddie before the hell
drop
dive fall it's rebranded a lot over this
has so many names
it is mysterious through the admin
it's strange how people can't quite
remember what it's called
i've heard if it when it gets shut down
uh every time
it comes back with a new name i have
also had possibly for legal reasons
yeah possibly by possibly also some
people say
but they say not everyone who goes down
the the
hell full actually comes out the other
end yeah
and to be fair some people have counted
and that is technically true
but legally speaking it's not true yeah
statistically we're fine it's a rounding
error
yeah yeah absolutely like because
because fundamentally
statistically it's a statistically
negligible number
yeah and also if you ask anyone for
names of people who went missing
they couldn't give you any yeah well
this is the thing this is the thing if
you
if you count up if you count up the
number of people who go in and the
number of people who come out
definitely fewer people come out but
no one remembers no one's no one's gone
missing
you know everyone who anyone remembers
coming into the park leaves the park
yeah i don't i don't think mr calcifer
would have stood for anything
so so unrespectable
uh it's uh no it just must be a broken
mechanism
boy listen to me mr calcifer he's done a
lot for me he's done a lot for this park
but there's a reason
i want you to follow in my footsteps and
not
what a role of that level of
responsibility
so the pipe the exit pipe where you know
the little window that you could see the
the water flowing back out the water's
no longer flowing back out
as though the exit pipe were blocked
with something so
during this miss pledges sort of
revelation i've been furiously
scribbling notes trying to get a
preliminary report down and at this
point i'm like right
well deal with dark force
that that that is quite enough um
this is very much out of my remit uh i
will be leaving now and filing a full
report with we need to get a specialist
uh team in here obviously something very
disturbing is going on right here and i
will
make to go away you do that you can't
you can't betray mr calcifer like that i
know it must be a surprise to you that i
have suddenly appeared because you
haven't been able to see me until now
gavin but i choose to speak to you
you must debrief with mr calcifer he
will want this i know
absolutely not my my responsibility you
have you have just just to be clear
oh yeah the whole time oh yeah
absolutely
i i absolutely will not i am an unbiased
observer and it is my response my legal
duty to to report this kind of things to
the governmental authority
oh can i try and convince gavin to stay
you can't really do roles or other
player characters like
oh yeah also i i don't feel like hey the
health inspector
ignore the spooky man and don't report
it
it's not a that's all just that's all
just
have that mr crumble
sir i will agree with you it is your
duty to report this and i think you
should first and foremost report this to
mr calcifer so he can take swift action
absolutely yes i would i will just try
and leave it there are some weird noises
coming from the pipe
that like comes from the hell for yeah i
will just try and leave cool
freddy is going to follow mr crumble
though i said i i will
uh i will show you the way out
no i know where it is it's down that
corridor and up the stairs i would like
to use
my ability which is back of my hand to
get to the
end of the corridor before mr grumble
does to stop
yeah okay yeah you can you can do that
there's definitely a secret passage down
here that you know of yeah absolutely
so at the bottom of the stairs ms pledge
is just waiting for you already
i can't believe that that the other two
player characters are part of the horror
as well i'll be honest
i i did i did not expect this to be like
i was expecting johnny to have to
prevent me from leaving in some way
not the other people who were like it's
fine
i'll be honest i really didn't expect
two of the three player characters
to side with the monster i don't think
it's fine
but you will not shut down this park
he's given us employment opportunities
in a very
struggling area he gave me a zero hour
contract
freddie is about to go full time
freddie is uh going to blow his whistle
and used it yet that's pretty loud
that's pretty loud
it hurts your ears a little bit uh in
fact
like ben and laura you you can take a
hit point damage from the loud whistle
in a confined space
because it's very good yeah i'm now
sandwiched between freddie and
miss pledge like like at the other end
of this
yeah you're currently small corridors
with one of them either side view
neither of them have actually like taken
any physical action to stop you leaving
but they are
oh no we wouldn't yeah i i just think
that we need to report to mr calcifer
and i'm sure that miss pledge knows a
short way there
it is uh very easy for us to get there
freddie you're facing towards the
stairs at the moment right mm-hmm yep
you know absolutely couldn't see
anything behind me
you notice no you noticed trickling down
the stairs
from the top a very thin but gradually
getting stronger flow of
dark black water uh um i
actually uh think uh maybe i'm an expert
in uh leaks and i have a little bit of a
concern that there is a
leak occurring above you uh so we should
definitely go
and report that to mr calcifer or people
will be in danger
and i know a shortcut follow me
excellent
so larry are you taking them up up and
out of the pump room
yes okay i want to find mr calcifer sure
so there's there's a also a ladder that
leads up to like
the top of the building that houses the
pump room stairs so you can
lead them up the ladder and it comes out
on like a sort of
first story rooftop as you open like
it's
technically by your watch it should only
be about 4 p.m
uh but as you open the the hatch at the
top of the stairs
the sky above you is a grim
twilight and as you look around
the floor of the entire park is now
covered with a thin layer
of dark black water the twilight sky
above almost
reflecting the encroaching darkness you
can see in the distance
that while the actual slide for the
hellfull has stopped working there's no
water flow down the water level in the
actual pool has just gradually kept
rising
and has now flowed out all over the park
below you
as you watch a woman in a bathing
costume
sort of uh holding a baby let's say
oh he's sort of wading through
looking around and suddenly she seems to
put
a foot through something and she just
disappears the water's only maybe
an inch deep but she falls and
disappears i'll say she puts the baby on
like a park bench
next to her okay the baby's okay baby's
okay for now but potentially oh no
oh no in peril as the water levels
continue to gradually rise
but that's something you can deal with
next episode
oh good yay as you stare out over the
flooded
sinister water park i'm sure the baby
will be fine let's find mr calcifer yeah
it's
it's it's fine it's fine what could
possibly go wrong
so thank you all for joining us for this
the very second episode of
i mean some nonsense how dare you
terrifying terrifying nonsense i'll have
you know
terrifying nonsense tm and the final
part
of before the twilight of the blind
abyss
will be next week although we're very
much during the twilight of the year
okay right yeah the the final part of
this blind
the situation will resolve next week
[Laughter]
