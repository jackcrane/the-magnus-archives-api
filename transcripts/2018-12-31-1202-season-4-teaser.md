##### [INT. HOSPITAL, JOHN'S ROOM]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON.]

##### [A clock ticks steadily in the background.]

##### [The door opens, and we get a brief few seconds of hallway noise before it is closed again.]

##### [We hear a few breaths, and a footstep or to as whoever entered makes their way to the bed.]

#### MARTIN

Hi, John. _(shaky breath)_

_(pause)_

Uh-hh... How are you? _(short pause) (short laugh)_ Yeah. Yeah, same here. It's -- _(inhale)_ It's bad all over, _(sigh)_ y'know? _[Hold I'm --]_ getting by, I suppose. Um... Basira's keeping things, taking over, and Melanie is -- _(sigh)_ Well, well,

##### [The "well" turns into a rueful laugh.]

#### MARTIN

Melanie is Melanie. _(laugh)_ Anyway, yeah, just -- thought I'd stop by. Check in and uh, y'know. See how you're, um --

_(pause) (sigh) (pause)_

We really need you, John. Everything's -- It's bad. I-I don't know how much longer we can do this. We -- *I* need you. And I-I know that you're not -- I know there's no way to -- 

_(soft, shaky breath)_ But we need you, John. John, please, just -- _(wet)_ *Please.* _(trying not to cry)_ If-If there's anything left in you that can still see us, or, or some power that you've still got, or, or, or, something, *anything,* please!

_(pause, more put together)_ Please. _(inhale, definitely about to cry)_ I-I can't --

##### [His phone buzzes three times -- it's on vibrate -- he gasps softly in surprise. We hear him get up from what, presumably, is a chair, and answer the phone. When he speaks, he's much more business-like, gives no sign that he was seconds away from crying not even a minute before.]

#### MARTIN (PHONE)

Yeah. Yeah, I know.

_(waits for response)_

I'm -- I'm actually with him now.

##### [He sniffs as he says this, the way you might try to get rid of a cold.]

#### MARTIN (PHONE)

You were right.

##### [He moves about.]

#### MARTIN (PHONE)

_(waits) (shaky breath)_ I --

_(big sigh)_

Will they be __safe__?

_(waits)_

Okay. _(more confident)_ Okay. I'll do it.

_(response)_

Yeah. Sure thing.

##### [Small sigh from Martin.]

#### MARTIN

_(to John)_ I'm sorry. Goodbye, John.

##### [Slight pause.]

##### [The door opens. We again hear the bustle of the hallway before it closes. The bustle is still audible in the background as the clock ticks on. Then --]

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
