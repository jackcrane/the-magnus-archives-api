##### [INT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, 2015]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON.]

##### [Clothes rustle.]

#### MARTIN

*Careful!*

#### TIM

Sh-hh!

##### [A door opens.]

#### TIM, SASHA, MARTIN

SURPRISE!

##### [Someone blows a party horn.]

#### ARCHIVIST

_(overlapping)_ *Jesus!*

#### TIM

Happy birthday, boss.

#### SASHA

*Happy --* Oh, _(laughing, a bit)_ are you okay?

#### ARCHIVIST

No, I! -- Christ, one second.

#### MARTIN

Sorry, sorry; Tim wanted to surprise you, and --

#### TIM

*Snitch.*

##### [Some papers have been rustling in the background over this.]

#### ARCHIVIST

No, no, it's *fine*, thank you. Just a -- shock.

#### TIM

_(duh)_ Well, that's the idea.

##### [Someone flips a page. Probably the Archivist.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Indeed. Though, uh, honestly, the bottle of wine was just fine.

##### [He pulls out a chair as he talks.]

#### TIM

Pfft, yeah, as a *decoy*.

#### ARCHIVIST

Yes, well, thank you. This is very -- _(rapid page flipping)_ *elaborate* of you.

#### SASHA

Plus, it was kind of fun, giving you a heart attack.

#### ARCHIVIST

*Mm*, I'm sure. I notice you didn't jump out at *Martin* when he had a birthday.

#### TIM

_(can hear his smile)_ No, he's *way* too jumpy as it is.

##### [Martin lets out a sound of singular offense.]

#### TIM

We were worried he might *damage* himself!

#### MARTIN

_(higher)_ Hey!

##### [Clothing sounds, as if he's folding his arms.]

#### MARTIN

_(hmph)_ Well -- I preferred going out for ice cream anyway.

#### ARCHIVIST

You went for ice cream?

#### SASHA

*Yes*, you were there!

#### MARTIN

You had -- rum and raisin, and taught us all about emulsifiers.

#### ARCHIVIST

Oh. Right, yes, _(unconvincing)_ I -- I remember.

#### TIM

_(smiling)_ *Liar*.

#### ARCHIVIST

Well, thank you anyway. This is all -- very touching.

#### TIM

We just wanted to do something to lighten the mood, you know?

#### ARCHIVIST

Yes, I'm -- _(inhale)_ aware it's been a -- rough start.

##### [He exhales.]

#### SASHA

_(*really?*)_ That's not what this was about; we just thought you could use a chance to unwind.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(exhale)_ I.. suppose it couldn't hurt.

##### [A soft knock on the door.]

#### JONAH MAGNUS _(AS ELIAS)_

Knock knock.

#### TIM

*Double* boss!

#### SASHA

Elias?

#### MAGNUS

I'm not too late for cake, am I?

#### ARCHIVIST

There's a cake?

#### TIM

How did y-- *Martin!* That was a secret!

#### MARTIN

_(high)_ I didn't say anything!

#### MAGNUS

He didn't have to. Nothing escapes my notice, and I like to keep an eye out for this sort of thing.

#### TIM

Well -- it's -- good to see you.

#### ARCHIVIST

Yes -- Y,yes! Come in?

#### MAGNUS

So, how old is the birthday boy?

#### ARCHIVIST

Uh -- thirty-eight.

##### [There's a sound that can be interpreted as Sasha either *tch*-ing or flicking him.]

#### SASHA

*Liar*.

##### [Everyone laughs.]

#### ARCHIVIST

_(petulant)_ How would *you* know.

#### TIM

What, does someone need to change their password again?

#### ARCHIVIST

I -- what?

##### [Tim laughs.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Sasha, have you been going through my computer --

#### SASHA

_(overlapping, definitely yes)_ *Definitely* not; No idea what he's talking about.

#### TIM

'Course not!

##### [They both keep laughing in the background.]

#### ARCHIVIST

_(mostly under his breath)_ That's *really* not appropriate.

##### [He sighs, unheard.]

#### MARTIN

Oh, come on, guys!

#### MAGNUS

*Anyways*. Somebody mentioned cake.

#### TIM

Uh, yeah. You did.

#### MAGNUS

_(inhale of mock surprise)_ Yes, I did, didn't I.

##### [Tim sighs.]

#### TIM

Alright, alright. Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag now, anyway, look -- just give me a second.

##### [Someone sighs. Again, probably the Archivist.]

##### [We hear some ceramic-type sounds as Tim gets out the cake.]

#### TIM

_(singing)_ *Happy birthday* --

##### [Everyone else joins in.]

#### EVERYONE

*-- to you.*

#### ARCHIVIST

_(dear god this is happening)_ *Oh*, okay.

#### MARTIN

Mhm!

#### EVERYONE

*Happy birthday to you.*

#### ARCHIVIST

Right!

#### EVERYONE

*Happy birth--*

#### ARCHIVIST

_(please cease)_ Yes!

##### [He sighs. No one listens.]

#### EVERYONE

*day, dear --*

#### TIM, SASHA, MARTIN

*-- Jo-on.*

#### MAGNUS

_(simultaneous)_ *-- Archivist.*

#### EVERYONE

*Happy birthday to you*.

#### ARCHIVIST

I --

#### TIM

_(overlapping, laughing)_ Yay!

#### ARCHIVIST

Alright, yes -- thank you. I do hope you're not planning to *light* those candles.

#### TIM

_(who, me?)_ Oh, goodness.

##### [He shakes a box of matches.]

#### TIM

A source of ignition? In the Archives?

##### [Sasha laughs.]

#### TIM

*Uh-oh*.

#### ARCHIVIST

Tim.

#### TIM

_(overlapping)_ Mmm.

*Oh.* Whoops! _(strikes a match)_ Sorry. My hand slipped.

##### [The flame crackles and burns into being.]

#### TIM

And again --

##### [A slight crackle as he lights a candle.]

#### TIM

And again --

##### [The same crackle.]

#### TIM

And a couple more times -- here, I'm so *clumsy*  today; that is a *lot* of fire.

##### [The candles continue to crackle in the background.]

#### ARCHIVIST

I'm *really* not *comfortable --*

#### SASHA

*So* blow them out, then.

#### ARCHIVIST

Oh. _(slight pause)_ Right, yeah --

#### MAGNUS

*And* make a wish.

#### ARCHIVIST

If I wish for you all to go away, do you think it'll work?

#### TIM

He's so *grumpy* today, isn't he Martin?

#### MARTIN

Uh -- oh! Well, um --

#### TIM

_(cutting him off)_ Do you think it's his looming sense of mortality?

##### [Martin splutters.]

#### MARTIN

Uh -- I, I don't think --

#### ARCHIVIST

*Fine.*

##### [He blows out the candles. Everyone cheers, someone claps.]

#### TIM

So, what did you wish for?

#### ARCHIVIST

I can't tell you.

#### MAGNUS

He wished for a little bit of peace and quiet.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(small inhale)_ Was it that obvious?

##### [Small exhale.]

#### MAGNUS

Oh, I wouldn't worry, John. It's an Archive. Quiet is very much the course du jour.

#### TIM

Well, after the party, at least. Wine, anyone?

#### ARCHIVIST

Tim, it's eleven in the morning.

##### [The cork pops.]

#### TIM

Pfft, yeah, at your *birthday party*.

##### [He begins pouring.]

#### ARCHIVIST

I *really* don't think it's *appropriate* --

#### MAGNUS

_(overlapping)_ I'll allow it. In fact! I'll join you.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(surprise)_ Oh! O-kay, um, a-al, alright then?

##### [Sounds of continued pouring behind all this.]

#### SASHA

Martin?

#### MARTIN

Oh! Uh, _(slight strained laugh)_ I mean -- I don't -- normally -- drink wine, you know -- t-tannins are a proven headache trigger, and so --

#### SASHA

*Martin.*

##### [More pouring sounds.]

#### MARTIN

W-, uh -- _(more stuttering)_ -- yeah, sure, maybe, just uh, a drop. Heh.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(more statement than question)_ You know that there's a lot of tannin in tea as well?

#### MARTIN

What?

#### ARCHIVIST

Hang on, have you been recording this?

##### [Clothing rustling.]

#### TIM

Oh! Yeah! I -- just thought it might be nice, you know, something to look back on when we're all old and sick of each other.

#### SASHA

You probably should have told us, Tim.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ What, are you afraid we're going to get sued over the *Happy Birthday* song?

#### MARTIN

_(slightly higher)_ Oh, oh, well I am *now!*

##### [Tim sighs.]

#### SASHA

It's just a bit of a privacy thing.

#### [ARCHIVIST]

_(under his breath, hmph)_ Oh, hypocrite.

#### TIM

_(overlapping)_ Alright, alright, *fine,* look. I'm turning it off. Any last words for your future selves?

#### ARCHIVIST

*Yes.* _(to the tape)_ *__Fire Tim.__*

##### [Tim laughs.]

##### [INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, PRESENT DAY]

##### [We hear the strange howling background designating our fearful new world.]

##### [The Archivist exhales, somewhat shakily.]

##### [Something creaks.]

##### [He breathes again.]

##### [More creaking.]

##### [There's a soft knock-knock-knock at the door.]

##### [Footsteps.]

#### MARTIN

_(gentle)_ Hey.

#### ARCHIVIST

Hi.

##### [His voice is rough, weary -- a stark contrast to the younger version of himself we just heard on the tape.]

##### [More footsteps as Martin gets closer.]

#### MARTIN

You, uh, listening to the tapes again?

##### [Some rustling sounds as he situates himself.]

#### MARTIN

How many times is that, now?

#### ARCHIVIST

They were sent to me, Martin. _(inhale)_ There's got to be some reason --

#### MARTIN

_(sigh)_ Gloating, John. Elias won, and there were some tapes he'd kept for himself, and he wanted to gloat. So he sent them. I, I don't see-

#### ARCHIVIST

_(overlapping)_ He's not. *Elias*.

#### MARTIN

*Jonah*, then. I don't know; I find it hard to think of him as -- _(pause, inhale)_ I don't really like to think of him.

##### [Silence.]

##### [Martin sighs.]

#### MARTIN

You should get some sleep.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(exhale)_ I -- _(sigh)_ Can't. I, I can't. I, I don't think I do anymore. Sleep. _(shaky sort of laugh)_ How long's it been, now?

#### MARTIN

I don't know. It's not like there are days to count, anymore, _(sigh)_ all the clocks are stopped, and...

##### [He trails off, somewhat shakily.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Well, I haven't yet. I get -- tired, but it doesn't feel the same.

##### [The safehouse creaks.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Probably for the best. Sleep doesn't look... pleasant.

#### MARTIN

...No, it's. _(unsteady inhale)_ It's. Not.

#### ARCHIVIST

I couldn't wake you.

#### MARTIN

I'm sorry.

#### ARCHIVIST

It's not --

##### [He sniffs, and then lets out a sound that's somewhat wheezy, almost strangled. It's unclear if it's a humorless laugh, or him near tears. Possibly both.]

#### ARCHIVIST

You're not the one who ended the world.

##### [The background howls. The safehouse creaks. Martin holds back a sigh.]

#### MARTIN

_(somewhat forced brightness)_ Well, just as well I don't remember my dream.

#### ARCHIVIST

I do.

#### MARTIN

What?

#### ARCHIVIST

_(inhale)_ I see most of the suffering around here. When it's quiet, it just -- It's like.. I can.. see it, like I'm watching all of it.

#### MARTIN

You haven't been opening the curtains.

#### ARCHIVIST

No, I don't need to.

*It* can see us here, and.. and I can see out as well.

#### MARTIN

O-kay, we'll just file that under -- *ominous* for now.

##### [A sigh.]

##### [More creaking.]

#### MARTIN

We *seem* safe enough in here, at least.

#### ARCHIVIST

I suppose so.

#### MARTIN

_(trying)_ Bit of a hideaway?

#### ARCHIVIST

Or a prison.

#### MARTIN

..Yes. Still, better than outside.

##### [More creaking. There's now a musical component of the *outside*. It sounds... full of iron. It sounds like a certain portion of *The Magnus Archives'* theme, though it's not entirely recognizable as such.]

#### MARTIN

It sounds bad.

##### [The Archivist laughs that strange, humorless laugh.]

#### ARCHIVIST

It is.

##### [Brief silence.]

#### MARTIN

*Are* we still safe?

#### ARCHIVIST

Y-Yes. It -- It doesn't want to harm me.

#### MARTIN

And me?

#### ARCHIVIST

I won't let it.

##### [More creaking.]

#### MARTIN

Um. _(uh)_ Thanks.

##### [More silence. More creaking.]

##### [A breath.]

##### [Clothes rustling.]

#### MARTIN

*John*, it's not your fault.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(sharp)_ Martin, can we __not__ do this again?

#### MARTIN

Sorry.

#### ARCHIVIST

I'm just -- I'm *mourning* a world I *killed* --

#### MARTIN

_(overlapping, placating)_ I know --

#### ARCHIVIST

_(increasingly fervent)_ and we're all *trapped* in its *rotting corpse!--*

#### MARTIN

Enough, John.

##### [The Archivist starts taking out a tape.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Have you heard the Gertrude one?

#### MARTIN

What?

#### ARCHIVIST

The Gertrude one; there are a few of them, but this is my favorite.

##### [Over their conversation, he gets the tape ready.]

#### MARTIN

_(sigh)_ I don't --

#### ARCHIVIST

Just. Listen.

##### [He puts the tape in.]

##### [INT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, GERTRUDE'S OFFICE, MARCH 20TH, 2015]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON.]

#### GERTRUDE

Right. If you're listening to this, then it is likely that -- _(she breaks off, sighs)_ No. Let's not beat around the bush. If you're listening to this, it means I'm dead. And you have been chosen to be my replacement as Head Archivist.

Hopefully, this means you, Sasha, but if someone else is hearing this, and Elias has made a different choice for some reason, then these words are still very much intended for you.

Before I continue: It is very important to be *absolutely* clear this is not a joke. Nor is it any sort of prank, or game. Your colleagues have not convinced me to record this as an attempt to... *haze* you. This is completely serious. And very, very important for you to know.

If it is you I'm talking to, Sasha, hopefully your background in Artefact Storage will lend a certain degree of.. credence to my words. But others may have to take it on trust.

All I can do is assure you I am deadly serious. _(sigh)_ So. The first thing you have to do is accept that you are in great danger, and will be for the rest of your life. There are now things that will actively be trying to kill you, due to your new role as Archivist, and Elias has plans for you that are little better.

You will also be unable to relinquish the position or quit the Institute, finding you are supernaturally compelled to remain.

In fact, it occurs to me that attempting to do so is probably the quickest and easiest way to establish the truth of what I am telling you, so I suggest you do so at the earliest possible opportunity.

Things you need to be aware of:

There exists in our world supernatural entities of incredible power that reflect and feed on the fears of all living creatures, but most commonly humans. Many consider them gods, and while I believe that is far too simplistic a comparison, for our purposes here it is perhaps the most useful shorthand.

They do not rule our world, but they do exercise considerable power, which they generally manifest in the form of monstrous beings that spread further fear -- or, incarnations, those humans who have willingly, though not always knowingly, chosen to take on the power of these entities.

You, unfortunately, have unwittingly made the decision to become one of those incarnations. For the Institute serves a being variously known as: The Eye, It Knows You, The Beholding, The Ceaseless Watcher. It is the fear of being watched, and judged, and having all your secrets known. The Institute serves as a way for it to harvest the fears of the other entities, dragging out the suffering of those who come to give statements and -- claiming their terror.

But, there is another part of being the Archivist. These.. beings, these.. gods of fear -- their followers believe that they have... rituals. Grand projects which, if successful, would allow them to enter our world, reshaping it in -- unthinkable ways. Molding it into a dimension where terror is as natural as gravity.

You are now one such ritual.

I do not know the exact details of it, but be wary of whatever Elias asks you to do.

Oh, yes. On the subject of Elias: Trust nothing he says. He was originally known as Jonah Magnus, the founder of this Institute, and I have known him also as James Wright, the previous head of this Institute.

He has certain... abilities of clairvoyance, which allow him to perceive out of any eye, real or symbolic, so be wary. Play ignorant as long as you can while you expand your own research.

I've managed to keep the Archives in a state of chaos for decades, as I believe his plan would benefit from their organization. But I leave that to your judgement. Certainly, the longer he is ignorant of how much you know, the better.

Above all else: be *ready*. There are many things out there loyal to other powers which know your importance to the Eye, and will want. You. Dead.

You are entering a new world, a place I've lived for most of my life. A place... _(she sighs)_ A place that will often demand a high price from you. Pay it without hesitation, because one way or another, the world is now on your shoulders. _(sigh)_

I wish I had more time to explain it to you. But time is short, and hopefully my actions tonight will ensure that this tape never needs to see the light of day.

But if you are hearing it, then -- good luck. Do what you have to do.

##### [She sighs, heavily.]

##### [The door opens.]

#### JURGEN LEITNER

Are you finished?

#### GERTRUDE

Jurgen! I told you to stay in the tunnels.

##### [Leitner walks in and pulls himself out a chair.]

#### LEITNER

Your message also told me it was urgent.

#### GERTRUDE

_(sharper)_ If Elias is watching right now --

#### LEITNER

Then your recording all that was meaningless anyway. Besides, I'm not afraid of him.

#### GERTRUDE

Bravado. _(heh/hm)_ Really?

#### LEITNER

Mmmmm -- it's not *bravado --*

#### GERTRUDE

We're wasting time. Do you still have the Ruskin book?

#### LEITNER

I do, though I don't relish the thought of using it. Makes it rather hard to breathe, like your chest is being --

#### GERTRUDE

_(overlapping)_ Do you know the gas main, a little way out in the tunnel?

#### LEITNER

I do.

#### GERTRUDE

I need you to move it.

#### LEITNER

_(hem-and-haw)_ Iiiii, ummmm. That's. I mean it's not just earth; there's pipework, and all sorts of --

#### GERTRUDE

*__Find__ a way.* I need it to be directly under the Institute, or at least closer.

#### LEITNER

I'm more likely to rupture it, and fill the place with gas.

#### GERTRUDE

_(heh)_ Hm, that would also be acceptable.

#### LEITNER

Mmm. I'll do what I can. _(sigh)_ When do you need it?

#### GERTRUDE

If my guess is right, the Church's ritual should be collapsing any time now, so -- immediately.

#### LEITNER

And if you're wrong?

#### GERTRUDE

Then a bit of gas will be the least of our worries.

#### LEITNER

...Right. What are you going to do?

#### GERTRUDE

Paper burns well.

##### [She holds up a container of liquid -- it sloshes.]

#### GERTRUDE

Petrol burns better.

##### [It sloshes again. Leitner laughs.]

##### [The container sloshes again as Gertrude sets it down.]

#### LEITNER

I always forget your pyromaniac streak.

#### GERTRUDE

Mm. Remind me to tell you about Agnes sometime.

#### LEITNER

Right. _(brief pause)_ Did you mean to leave the tape running?

#### GERTRUDE

Oh, good *grief*. Forty years I've been using them, and I *swear*, I'll nev--

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]

##### [INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, PRESENT DAY]

##### [Back to the howling world.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Can you imagine? If we'd had this?

#### MARTIN

But we didn't, did we.

#### ARCHIVIST

No --

#### MARTIN

So there's no point in dwelling. _(heavy breath)_ John, I  -- This isn't healthy.

#### ARCHIVIST

*Healthy?* I am an Avatar of voyeuristic terror, who unquestioned *craving* for knowledge has condemned the entire world to an eternity of torment; *healthy* i-isn't -- i,it's not --

#### MARTIN

Fine, fine. I get it.

#### ARCHIVIST

Besides. G- _(shaky)_ Grief... is healthy. I,If nothing else, it pushes away the other feelings that that -- *thing* wants me to experience.

#### MARTIN

It just -- It *hurts* me to see you wallowing like this.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(snapping)_ Well, some of us weren't able to cut ourselves off from the world before it ended.

##### [The safehouse creaks.]

#### MARTIN

That's not fair.

#### ARCHIVIST

No, it's not; I'm -- I'm sorry, I just -- _(large shaky breath)_ It hurts.

#### MARTIN

I know.

#### ARCHIVIST

I need time.

#### MARTIN

I know. But we can't stay in this cabin forever.

#### ARCHIVIST

Why not? It -- It's quiet, here, and I have you.

##### [It's Martin's turn for a humorless sound- half laugh, half exasperated sigh.]

#### MARTIN

What about food?

#### ARCHIVIST

What about it? When's the last time you thought to eat, or even felt hungry?

#### MARTIN

_(quietly)_ What? _(louder, a revelation)_ Uh -- I don't know.

#### ARCHIVIST

No. Whatever is sustaining us now doesn't need us to eat.

#### MARTIN

That -- That can't be possible.

#### ARCHIVIST

It's a new world, Martin; the natural laws are whatever they want them to be. And I suspect they don't much care to keep humanity fed and watered.

#### MARTIN

_(inhale)_ Well, that as may be, we can't just stay here forever.

#### ARCHIVIST

What could possibly be out there that you want to see?

#### MARTIN

A way to stop this, a way to turn the world back!

#### ARCHIVIST

_(softer)_ Do you really think there is one?

#### MARTIN

Well, if there is, it's not in here, is it?

#### ARCHIVIST

It's so -- _(shaky breath)_ It's so... *loud*, out there? The agony, the, the terror, I can see it all so much more clearly.

#### MARTIN

I'm sorry.

#### ARCHIVIST

No, it's -- _(sigh)_ I love you, I just -- _(inhale)_ I need more time.

##### [Pause.]

#### MARTIN

It's alright.

##### [Movement. Creaking. An exhale.]

#### MARTIN

It's alright; I'm good at waiting.

#### ARCHIVIST

_(near whisper)_ Thank you. _(more normal)_ I just wish it didn't feel like whatever's out there was waiting, too.

#### MARTIN

...Yeah.

##### [Brief silence, then-]

##### [Clothes rustling.]

#### MARTIN

Hey -- Hey, when did you start recording?

##### [The safehouse creaks.]

#### ARCHIVIST

_(confusion)_ I -- didn't. I only brought one, and I've been using it to play the tapes.

#### MARTIN

*Oh.* _(sigh)_ That's not a great sign.

#### ARCHIVIST

No. No, it's not.

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
