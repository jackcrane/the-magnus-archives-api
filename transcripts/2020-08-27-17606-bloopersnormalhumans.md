#### ALEX NEWELL

-- We can use "nondescript" for normal-looking... Again, I've never known anyone to say the word "nondescript" in conversation.

#### FAY ROBERTS

_[forebodingly]_ *You* would.

##### [ALEX SNORTS]

#### FAY ROBERTS

*I* might.

##### [ALEX LAUGHS]

But normal people might not...

#### IAN HAYLES

Not "normal people," people who aren't in this room.

#### LYDIA NICHOLAS / MELANIE

I'll play it their way for now. But, _[stomach growling]_ when it comes down to it --

#### ALEX NEWELL

Sorry, got your stomach.

#### LYDIA NICHOLAS

-- my stomach! I'm really hungry, Alex! Look, it's a *growl* -- it's atmospheric, it won't foul the --

#### ALEX NEWELL

It sounds like a creaking ship.

##### [LAUGHTER]

It was like a ship in a storm. _[wood-creaking noises]_

#### LYDIA NICHOLAS

Look, mate, I'm hungry all the time. -- should I just go away, get chips, and come back?

Yup, yup, yup.

#### ALEX NEWELL

Go from top; also, for the "all clear," could you do this one -- louder? I don't know --

#### FRANK VOSS

I don't know why, but you said "louder" and in my head I was like -- "higher pitched?!"

##### [LAUGHTER]

#### ALEX NEWELL AND JONNY SIMS

_[falsetto]_ "All clear?"

#### FRANK VOSS

Basically.

#### ALEX NEWELL

_[falsetto]_ It's me, Terrence, the very small air-raid warden!

##### [LAUGHTER]

#### FAY ROBERTS

Um, so yeah, if you can go, uh, louder with it --

#### JONNY SIMS

Editor's Note: We're having a *great* time.

#### MIKE LEBEAU

_[falsetto]_ "Good!" _[snort]_ _[more-normal]_ "Good. Good!"

#### ALEX NEWELL

-- the moment you're going, _[lower]_ "Good," it should be _[higher]_ "Good!" "Good!"

#### MIKE LEBEAU

_[overlapping]_ "Good!" All right.

#### ALEX NEWELL

"Good!", you *fffucking dickhead.*

#### MIKE LEBEAU

_[overlapping]_ Fucking... *Fuck __you__!* Ran away from me, just like my dad!

Ben and -- Zim, sorry, can you talk amongst yourselves for a second?

#### BEN MEREDITH

_[rapid monotone]_ I am talking to you like a normal human being.

#### FRANK VOSS

_[rapid monotone]_ Yes. This is a conversation that normal human beings would have.

#### BEN MEREDITH

_[rapid monotone]_ Excellent. Yes.

#### FRANK VOSS

_[overlapping, rapid monotone]_ Fantastic.

##### [THEY LAUGH AT THEIR OWN HUMANITY]

#### ALEX NEWELL

-- and now I've gone too far the other way -- again -- that was *golden*, by the way, that's *exactly* what I need.

##### [ALEX AND FRANK LAUGH]

#### BEN MEREDITH

That's official: This is what Alex thinks human interaction looks like.

#### FRANK VOSS

I mean, it makes sense, he grew up on a farm.

#### BEN MEREDITH

That's how you talk to sheep, I hear.

#### FRANK VOSS

*Yes.*

##### [FRANK AND BEN LAUGH]

#### ALEX NEWELL

-- who's on mic four...?

#### FAY ROBERTS

Uh, that would be me.

#### ALEX NEWELL

'kay, can all *three* of you have a human interaction, now?

#### FAY ROBERTS

I... I'm not sure I really want to, if I'm honest.

#### FRANK VOSS

I mean, it's very simple, you just, you know -- you say, "hello, I'm a human," and, uh...

#### BEN MEREDITH

You just --

#### FAY ROBERTS

_[overlapping]_ _[earnestly]_ Really? "H-h-hello, I'm a human...?" Like that?

#### BEN MEREDITH

_[rapid monotone]_ *Exactly,* yes, that was very convincing, I am also a human, hello.

#### FAY ROBERTS

I feel convinced.

#### FRANK VOSS

_[rapid monotone]_ Yes, I, three, am human.

#### BEN MEREDITH

_[monotone]_ I am continuing to talk like a human.

Ben: you crept closer and closer and closer...

#### BEN MEREDITH

Well, damn...!

#### JONNY SIMS

_[squeaky voice, apparently mimicking Alex]_ To the mic...!

#### ALEX NEWELL

You're a good villain! You know, a good villain needs to *make love* to the microphone...!

##### [LAUGHTER, OVERLAPPING]

#### ALEX NEWELL

But, uh, _[femme fatale voice]_ you're kind of getting all up in my grill, Ben...

#### BEN MEREDITH

_[overlapping]_ _[femme fatale voice]_ Sure, yeah...

#### ALEX NEWELL

...You're getting all up into my pop filters, Ben.

Um...

#### JONNY SIMS

_[villainous]_ Make love to the microphone -- make *hate* to the audience!

I'm just very *intimate* with Beholding.
