summary:         "Back in the heady days of late 2019, we sought ideas from our Patrons on a more light-hearted scene from life at The Magnus Institute and the Archives. And they certainly delivered in spades. <br/><br/>We present to you one of the winning entries, <b>Epiphany</b>; a joyous romp in the Archives in this imagined scene from the latter half of Season 1. <br/><br/>We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed producing it. Alex, in particular, had a lot of fun with this. As you'll no doubt hear..."

##### [Rich piano music, like the type you might hear as the opening to an extremely cheesy Austen adaptation.]

#### ALEX

Hi, everyone. Alex here: part-time nightmare merchant, full-time sweetheart.

I'm here to talk to you about hope, joy, and other fluffy human feelings I've been made aware of recently.

Life is hard; we get it. The world is a scary place at the moment, and it can sometimes feel- cruel. Dark. And willfully manipulated by inhuman monsters who don't have your best interests at heart.

Well, we here at Rusty Towers *do* have your best interests at heart, and we wanted to do something nice for all of you who are feeling- a bit overwhelmed. A bit peaky. A bit- so-so.

That's why we ran the Magnus Archives Fluff Competition: a chance for fans to write their *own* Magnus Archives content, horror-free and full of love.

So curl up under a blanket with the warm liquid beverage of your choice, close your eyes, and enjoy the first of the winning entries:

"Epiphany," by Jack Beckwith.

"Epiphany." By M. K. Blackwood.

##### [The door opens; Martin yelps.]

##### [We hear footsteps as someone walks in.]

#### TIM

_(cheery)_ *Martin!*

##### [Martin is still busy being startled.]

#### TIM

What are you up to?

#### MARTIN

_(__obviously__ I have nothing to hide)_ Ha-ha! Hmm! Nothing; nothing-- Notes! _(nervous laugh)_ I, w-- notes! Yes.

#### TIM

Hm.

#### MARTIN

_(overlapping)_ I was-- taking notes--

##### [The poem's paper(s) crinkle.]

#### MARTIN

I have g-- _(nervous laugh)_ Can I-- *help* you?

#### TIM

Oh! Uh, I thought I'd see how quarantine sleepaway camp is treating you.

#### MARTIN

_(surprised, pleased)_ Oh!

#### TIM

Brought down a-- change of sheets for your cot; uh, thought you might need it.

#### MARTIN

_(same tone)_ Oh, that's-- Thanks, Tim; that's-- that's really kind!

#### TIM

Anything... on your mind?

#### MARTIN

Oh -- _(heh)_ Plenty! Homesick, mortal terror --

##### [Tim hums in agreement.]

#### MARTIN

-- you know, the usual.

##### [Tim hums again, and continues to do so at the appropriate intervals as Martin continues:]

#### MARTIN

I was, I was actually thinking of trying to go see my mum, but, well, the -- _(inhale)_ -- the *worms*, and, you know, plus sometimes she can be --

##### [Martin makes the sort of frustrated sound -- and this is very specific -- that you make when giving an accurate description of the person/situation you've just mentioned would be too mean or rude for you to disclose to the present company, but to say anything kinder would be a lie.]

##### [Meanwhile, Tim's **hm**s are becoming less well-timed and more pointed.]

#### TIM

_(cutting him off)_ Yeah, that's great -- Anything else?

#### MARTIN

_(sorta stunned)_ What?

#### TIM

Oh, come off it, Martin; I *saw* you in the break room the other day.

#### MARTIN

...How do you mean?

#### TIM

Sasha and I were hosing down some of our little visitors with a friendly CO2 bath, and you could hardly be bothered by *any* of it. You were just -- there, staring wistfully off into space, running your finger around the rim of your mug!

#### MARTIN

I -- was. Distracted.

#### TIM

You *like* someone.

##### [The response is immediate:]

#### MARTIN

*Wha --* _(__loud scoff__)_ Wh-- Well -- That's -- I mean --

#### TIM

*Mm.*

#### MARTIN

_(slight nervous laugh)_ I could hardly --

#### TIM

*Mhm.*

#### MARTIN

I, I really don't --

#### TIM

Called it! Sasha owes me a fiver.

##### [This against Martin continuing to sputter in the background, eventually giving up and sighing.]

#### TIM

So -- _(lowers his voice for secrets)_ Who is it?

#### MARTIN

_(fast)_ I don't have to tell you anything!

#### TIM

Is it Rosie? I know you've been talking about her a lot lately.

#### MARTIN

_(still fast)_ Is, is, is this an interrogation now?

#### TIM

So it *is* Rosie!

#### MARTIN

_(sputtering)_ That makes no -- _(more sputtering)_ It's not -- it's *not* Rosie; Tim, *listen --*

#### TIM

_(overlapping, dramatic)_ *Alllll*right; alright; we're getting somewhere.

Oh. Oh! It's not *David*, is it?

#### MARTIN

_(soft)_ What?

##### [There is a not small amount of *what on Earth made you think that?* to his tone.]

#### TIM

Oh*, Martin;* you can do better -- I mean, did you *see* what he was wearing? --

#### MARTIN

_(overlapping)_ Tha-- It, it -- It's not David. And I don't want to do this! Okay?

Now, if you'd could just please let me get back to th--

#### TIM

_(steamrolling)_ I mean, Hannah's married --

##### [Martin sighs.]

#### TIM

That doesn't *necessarily* mean that it's *not* her.

##### [In the background under him, Martin is continuing to sigh and gripe, ending in:]

#### MARTIN

No, no! *No.*

#### TIM

...Or wait. Are you being so dodgy about this because it's *one of us?*

##### [Brief pause; enough for Tim to take whatever Martin's expression is as confirmation. He breaks out into a laugh- part disbelieving, part triumphant. Martin sighs.]

#### TIM

Is it Sasha? Is it?

#### MARTIN

_(sighing)_ Tim, I'm literally begging you.

##### [Brief pause.]

#### TIM

Alright, fine, fine. Have it your way. Keep your precious secrets. But -- between you and me, can I at least offer you a little advice?

#### MARTIN

I -- get the feeling you're going to anyway.

#### TIM

Look. Nobody's gonna notice you if you don't notice *yourself* first.

##### [Pause.]

#### MARTIN

*What?*

#### TIM

Okay, look, that came out wrong; look --

What I mean is: Take care of yourself. Because I *know* you, Martin. You will give yourself away until there's nothing left of you to love.

##### [Brief pause.]

#### MARTIN

That's not fair.

#### TIM

Oh, it's true. And you know it.

#### MARTIN

...*Maybe*.

#### TIM

Look, I'm telling you this as a friend. Just -- think about it, okay? Whoever this is, they'll see -- _(slight sigh)_ They'll see how great you are not because of what you have to give away, but because of where you stand firm.

And after all of -- well, whatever the hell's been happening here -- you deserve something for yourself.

#### MARTIN

_(softer)_ Hey, that -- _(inhale)_ That really means a lot. _(exhale)_ Thanks. I -- I *will* think about it.

##### [He gives a slight laugh.]

#### TIM

Good.

Alright, well, I'm going to head out. I've got some books to take back to the library.

#### MARTIN

Take care of yourself too.

#### TIM

Always do!

##### [He gives a little *pew-pew* sound -- presumably accompanied by finger guns, though we'll never *really* know.]

##### [The door closes behind him as he leaves.]

##### [Martin flips back to his poem, clicks on the secondary tape recorder again.]

#### MARTIN

Right, where -- where was I? Uh, yeah, yeah, okay. _(deep inhale)_

> I was not expecting this:
> 
> For the sharp pain of jaws to give way
> 
> to y--

##### [He cuts off again as the door opens again.]

#### MARTIN

G- *Oh my god, Tim; normal people knock!*

#### TIM

_(overlapping)_ Sorry!

#### MARTIN

*Normal people knock!*

#### TIM

Sorry!

Hey. _(audible grin)_ It's not me, is it?

#### MARTIN

_(exhale)_ Would you *stop*!

#### TIM

Because if it *is*, you know --

Dance card's open.

#### MARTIN

Just go away; just go *away*, Tim.

#### TIM

Just putting it out there! Alright, alright.

##### [The door closes behind him as he leaves again.]

#### MARTIN

_(heavy exhale)_ *Okay!*

##### [The paper(s) crinkle again as he prepares to start reading again. He exhales one more time in a little *phew*.]

#### MARTIN

> You cannot hide from me
> 
> any longer, _(getting emotional)_ but I will try to hide from y--

##### [A quiet knock-knock on the door.]

#### MARTIN

_(riled up, assuming Tim)_ Oh, what? *What?* _(paper crinkles)_ *What?* _(through gritted teeth)_ What.

##### [The door opens.]

#### ARCHIVIST

What are you so irritable about?

#### MARTIN

_(__oh__)_ Oh.

##### [He *heh*s. The door closes behind the Archivist.]

#### MARTIN

_(finding words)_ Just been having a bit of a time.

#### ARCHIVIST

Mm, haven't we all? _(inhale)_ What did Tim want; he was *grinning.*

#### MARTIN

T-Tim? Oh, um -- we were -- _(inhale)_ -- comparing notes on the Hither-Green case.

#### ARCHIVIST

Oh. I see. Did you get anywhere?

#### MARTIN

Maybe? Too soon to tell.

#### ARCHIVIST

Alright, well, keep me updated. Uh, I also wanted you to try and track down a Mr. Marcus McKenzie. His father gave a statement in 2003; I'm trying to follow up. Bit worried about this one.

##### [He sighs.]

#### MARTIN

What, you? _(slight laugh)_ The -- The father of all skepticism, worried?

##### [He gives another little *heh*.]

#### ARCHIVIST

Just because I don't think it happened doesn't mean I can't be worried.

#### MARTIN

Hm.

#### ARCHIVIST

Are *you* alright?

#### MARTIN

What?

#### ARCHIVIST

Down here, I mean. _(inhale)_ Uh -- After everything, but out of house and home; it's not exactly five-star accommodations.

#### MARTIN

Oh, heh. You don't need to worry about me.

#### ARCHIVIST

I believe I've made my case for being entitled to worry, Martin.

#### MARTIN

Of course. _(long inhale)_ Well -- _(exhale)_ Really; I'm, I'm fine.

#### ARCHIVIST

Alright. Well, in that case -- _(soft exhale as he pauses)_

_(stricter)_ Get back to work. Just because you're living here doesn't mean it's not still a place of business.

##### [He opens the door and lets himself out.]

#### MARTIN

_(after him)_ You're not fooling me. _(notices the tape running)_ Oh!

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]

##### [Piano music comes back in.]
