[Music]
hello everyone
it's johnny welcome back to our interim
gaming adventure the title of which
i have definitely remembered because we
are recording this all
in one long session definitely haven't
had any sort of
technical break no one's computer's
motherboard died
in the middle of an episode what what
that didn't happen i don't know what
you're talking about
yeah so love to continue
exactly from where we left off with
nobody misremembering any details
something about an abyss yeah there was
it was the the thought
of the twilight of the blind of the
abyss
of the blinding abyss the blind abyss
the blind yeah yeah cool so welcome back
any continuity errors are actually very
clever and you just didn't get
a darkness in the fabric of of being
ripping through uh reality exactly
so as we've mentioned i'm johnny your
gm and who do we have just talking
nonsense
um i'm ben listen to the stellar firmer
and
rust cool gaming stuff like who you
playing stop stop plugging and tell me
who you're playing i'm ben nub gumgav in
crumble
gavin crumble and uh lydia who are you
i'm i'm lydia i i'm
also in uh magnus and rusty quit gaming
which is good
i'm assured by objective people that
aren't in it
that's not true i don't know anyone
that's not in it
we all are bit parts in alex and
johnny's dances
and i'm playing freddie who is a himbo
so i can't remember the voice so it's
gonna be
uh this now um i'm afraid
what did freddie sound like we can't
have two welsh people fred
mr crumbles that's more i suppose i'm
thinking more of the family i've got in
wrexham where it's kind of like on the
edge of welsh
just saying mr crumble a few times was
it kind of deep
you were like oh i'm freddie
well i like that keep that hello i'm
freddy
um okay this will be freddy uh i'm
actually kind of doing an impression of
that
dog that's very famous on tick tock
hello uh
there's a tick-tock dog yeah
i'm just gonna gently highlight that
we're four minutes in and
we've yet to introduce four people it's
fine
it's fine hello who are you hello
i'm laurie and i edit gaming and
i produce magnus archives and i'm
playing miss pledge and she's she's old
as balls
and very welsh and is very very invested
in freddy's future
and that he goes full time soon which as
he has been promised i think mr mr
calcifer
sir he did promise definitely happen
yeah i mean he didn't say it in as many
words he just made there was a feeling
you know
did he chuckle ominously and you were
like that's what that means that's a
good that's a good sign that is
definitely
a good sign that chuckle yes you awake
atop the pump room in slide world
feeling like something slightly weird
and slightly wrong has gone on with the
world
as though everything has shifted
slightly and any
inconsistencies are to be put down
to the leaking in of cosmic space fabric
into otherwise very normal chlorinated
water oh
i swear my shirt used to be white not
purple but uh
it's a good look on you gavin does my
hair still look good
uh freddy mumbles nervously at miss
pledge freddy of course it does my love
phew but your contemplation of changes
in shirt color and or voices
is broken by the sound of a baby crying
and you remember that a small baby
that whose parent you you cannot
remember at all as far as you're aware
this this baby
must have bought their own ticket and
that seems normal to you
this baby is on a like a bench
like a wooden bench this is you know one
of them slide park
wooden benches that you get yeah and the
flood of pitch black water
that occasionally you can see glimmers
of stars in
is starting to rise going up and up
towards
this this baby is the door that we came
out of onto the roof
a trapdoor is that rip off could it be
surfed
there isn't really like there are there
isn't really much in the way of like
waves currently in the uh in the
cosmic that one might gather from
running
across the roof jumping off
and then jumping onto the surfboard and
i will say freddy does not know enough
to know
that that is not possible right yes but
i can declare a lack of understanding
gives me immunity to things harming me
i absolutely cannot remember the rules
oh yeah there's dice is roll 2d6
also beach boys intensifies we're
indoors aren't we
everybody's surfing surfing dorset
i spent my first 18 years in dorset you
nobody surfs in dorset
or at least if they do surf in dorset
like loads of people do
johnny i went to pool harbor yeah
windsurfing in poole harbour
okay i love it windsurfing several times
even from dorset like i i lived 10
minutes
from bournemouth beach yep and like if
you saw people trying to surf it was
like it was
no but it was a bit of a sad affair
surfing around pool harbor is pretty
yeah okay no windsurfing
yeah pretty sure i saw some people try
surfing on shell bay didn't go well for
them but they tried
yeah okay
yeah don't try to surf i'm just saying
that like if your image of surfing is
like
cool uh that is not the surfing you will
find in dorset
yeah well freddie thinks that he looks
cool and uh i mean let's find out he
rolls 2d6 you're gonna need
i would say a 10 but you've got himbo
will work for you here so uh you'll need
an eight
yeah it doesn't really matter because i
got three three
rips the trapdoor off leaps off the roof
have it runs along the swell of the
baywatch theme
there's an echo it's obviously in a
minor key very much
because it's misplayed she's got a
lovely voice she's welsh
[Laughter]
do you like the baywatch theme what in
the valleys
that's the pretty much thing i keep
trying to have it in my head and all i
can hear is like the chariots of fire
like
because they roast they run slowly right
so that's a fire that's the slow run
song
it's doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
sounds like you're doing the 18 theme
badly
and now i've got the red dwarf theme in
my head okay so
anything i know that goes slowly
gradually we're gradually progressing
through
uh freddie's action he's currently
midday yeah well this is the problem
though is that momentum doesn't seem to
quite work he's got the wrong tune in
his head the rhythm's off
so the door hits the water and for a
second
freddie's like i'm doing it i'm doing it
i'm doing it but then the door sort of
starts to
slide down into the water and then
your feet and then your legs and then
i'll never let go
he says by the time uh by the time you
reach the bench with the baby it's just
your upper torso
that like is gripping onto
paddleboarding
oh yeah it's gripping onto the the edge
the baby is there right in your face
and the entire lower part of your body
is currently dangling into the unending
cosmos okay
it's it's pretty cold i'm gonna say you
are taking
two hit points of damage oh cool i've
got
five hit points so that's now i'm on
three as far as you two are concerned
freddie never had legs
freddie was also always just a talk just
in the upper torso
yeah the baby is currently crawling
towards you freddie looking curious
as though it's it's interested in your
face
come on baby how did you get a ticket
you won't be able to go on
any of the rides miss pledge
what are you doing watching freddie
struggle i think that she'd press
probably shout freddie boy
pull yourself onto the bench because i
haven't got my mop anymore do i try and
help
i know your mom is actually as far as i
recall one of the things that caused
this issue
i was defending my boy so i just
listened to the authority figure in the
room this would have been fine
oh shut up gavin you mean mr kelsifer
he's always is gavin crumble doing
anything or is gavin also simply
watching
an unfurling disaster gavin really wants
to get back to his van to report
this because he doesn't know how to
handle abyss floods
and he's pretty sure head office might
have an idea they've probably got
something in her handbook
so he just really needs to get back to
his van so he's going to look for
roots to yeah you can do the uh like
it'll be like hopping over
rooftops and the occasional awning
you can see that the edge of slide world
has not quite been reached by the flood
yet
okay so your your van should be fine
if you can get to it okay uh and i'm
gonna say i am motivated uh by a cold
fury of these
two individuals but just to be clear you
are leaving freddie to die
well no as far as i'm aware freddie's
fine because freddie never had
the rest of his body his face
is you know what covered in baby sick oh
yeah
you're quite right the baby has been
sick on your face
well not like fully sick just like spit
up a bit you know stress baby that's
what they do
you know i know the baby seems fine baby
seems very happy okay so there you go so
so freddie's just babysitting a pretty
chill baby
on a bench okay so yeah so to make your
own way
back i will say that's a innate
difficulty i will give you analytical
though because
it's very much like plotting out your
have you ever done this
i mean it's like i always have this
thing when i'm traveling around
like i'll i'll imagine that gravity has
changed
direction and then i'll like plot out
roots like how i would go down a street
if
gravity's done do you not do this is
this i've never done that
but i think i might start doing it now i
have done but not like a matter of
course
well i mean look no okay it's not it's
not something i do every day it's just
it's just sometimes isn't it it's just
yeah
anyway you're just basically playing uh
the floor is
cosmos yeah so uh yeah maybe you're
wrong
right i rolled a uh-oh
[Laughter]
and four and four okay you
make it i'm gonna say like at one point
your
leg slips briefly goes into the unending
black a bit of space
uh it gets a bit chilly but you pull it
back out so i'm gonna say you lose one
hit point okay you reach your van
but as you do the black waters are
starting to lap at its tires
i'm flicking through the health
inspection handbook for
any any uh like emergency protocols for
abyss floods
what letter are you looking under
f for flood f for flood uh okay you know
this quote it's quite a comprehension i
mean there's a very comprehensive
section on flood
generally the advice is to first off
turn it off at the source
okay and then look into most parts
should have drainage so if it's not
draining away
you probably want to look into what
might be blocking the drainage systems
but
mostly it the the advice is stop water
coming out
drain off water and then analyze the
system for the initial problem okay
all right uh well i'm gonna have a rifle
through the back of my van
and uh oh superpower right yeah
well yeah i can get mundane equipment i
can get specialized equipment for by
spending an hp and i only have three hp
left so um
uh well would i be able to find some
sort of because i'm aware
the the the flood is miserable in some
ways
it's not something i want to get on me
it's very cold so some
sort of like i've got like a long grabby
articulated stick for like sort of
getting it i'll
i'll say you have a grabby stick uh i
wouldn't make you spend a hit point for
a grabby stick
i suppose it's quite mundane yeah i've
got three with me right now
uh so i'll get a grabby stick at the
thing one thing i will say you do notice
is things don't seem to have a problem
floating on top of this dog well i did
oh
well no yeah it's it's it seems to be
anything submerged in the dark water
falls okay in which case i would like to
spend a day a hit point yep
to have an inflatable life raft yes
i will say okay let me
you cannot have a life raft you can't
have two
life rings oh blimey yeah all right i'll
take it
you're gonna have to sit in it in that
kind of thing with your bum sitting in
the middle
yeah my bum's gonna be really cold and
don't you also have some paddles
you also have some candles for my life
what a sensible thing to pack
okay i want two hit points okay yeah so
i i guess
like there's a moment of quiet as i'm
doing the things
and then i burst out the back of the van
to the 18 theme of course
and i'm like yeah sort of kneeling on
a life ring with another life ring like
gripped in my teeth because they have
the little ropes on them
and they're paddling with two hands okay
uh behind you
the van sinks into the spilling outside
uh what have you been doing this pledge
has actually been inspired by gavin
we're in a water park there must be
dingies around
miss pledge knows this park like the
back of her hand she's going to try and
find a dinghy there aren't any dinghies
but you do know where the gift shop
is and the gift shop sells all sorts of
like inflatable stuff
for children like water wings and that
sort of thing flamingos
inflatable flamingos you know like the
yes
absolutely uh so i will hora i forgot
the spooky flamingos i will allow you to
make your way down to the gift shop
and get yourself an inflatable flamingo
it will cost you a hit point though
largely because you will be partially in
the
the dark freezing void of space miss
pledge will do that for freddie
she doesn't care about the baby just to
be clear for freddie okay to be fair
on the flamingo we are in that we are
firmly into that element of horror
that's like the absurdity of the mundane
on the backdrop of everything yes oh
absolutely absolutely
nothing says mundanity like a inflatable
and dorset and dorset dorset is the the
most money
so uh freddie the dark waters are
starting to creep up over the top
of the the bench oh dear the baby's
there
it's like it doesn't really care what
are you doing freddie's
pulling himself onto the bench yep i'll
let you do that okay cool
and uh freddie is uh grabbing the baby
and looking around
for anything that he might jump onto
is there any anything even another
there's gavin
approaching quite speedily
we'll blow the whistle in order to
attract attention
all right you know and maybe to inspire
everyone to
to confidence in action you know
whistles are good for that
okay uh so i will judge that you regroup
to the sound of a very loud whistle yeah
each with your blowing the chair it's a
fire thing
[Laughter]
how am i meant to maintain a steady tone
of dread
when there are jokes happening i'll i'll
ask you to keep your jokes to your own
podcast
please he put a blase baby on a bench to
be honest so
johnny started it i i don't know what
you're talking about this is the coolest
baby i've ever
been it's like like larry said i want
serious horror
yeah all three episodes uh and i i feel
like i've delivered
oh no taken thank you i mean to to add a
modicum
of a power of a shade
of darkness to the proceedings freddie
does
yell for mr calcifer oh mr calcifer
you you said this was a good park
you can see if you look over towards
like the balcony
next to his office a dark stick thin
figure
is overlooking the unfolding carnage
what should we do
mr calcifer is it's now become
sad just distantly on the breeze
you learn to swim right that does
actually sound like useful advice
i see that oh dear so what's your next
move
uh well i'll if you said we've regrouped
i'll throw freddie
a life ring and a paddle so i'll i'll
judge you all now have
broadly speaking the ability to move
throughout this flooding park
though freddie is clutching a baby and
sad
and sad and sad the betrayal of
everything he stood for which was a
water park
so the the health inspectors manual
recommends that we
we find the blockage and clear it it
seems the water isn't draining away
which is a problem i don't know why i've
become a man from the radio
i mean ben in a very literal way you are
a man from the radio you are you you
have been a man from the radio
for so many that's very true yeah well i
i don't know
miss pledge you would know you know the
park like the back of it where is the
big drain
the big drain it's by fluttery bye byes
you know the kids are sick a lot so we
need the quick exit there
yes you're right it must be blocked come
on let's go i have my regulation
drain grabber oh good because i've lost
my mop
and i've got a baby oh congratulations
so you yeah you can paddle over
to uh fluttery bye-byes not not to be
confused with buttery fly-bys
no other side of the park yeah
absolutely our narrator
but larry could you could you describe
fluttery bye-byes for me because i
believe it was your
you were the one that invented it or was
it i invented the toilet bowl
but i believe fluttery bye-bye was the
the ride that
shoots the children in inflatable
rings that have wings on them that don't
make them any more aerodynamic in fact
makes them
spin a lot hence the vomit hence the
need
okay so at the moment uh so you approach
and as you do
you can see children in inflatable rings
just being
fired up and like but and like
skirting a top atop this dark black
abyss
and there's just this sort of collection
of floating slightly confused children
just off to one side about 10 of them
just
sort of rotating slowly
i mean i'm not i've got no time for them
we're heading straight for the drain
it's over here
okay as you approach uh the large drain
you can see there's a glow starting to
come up
from below the pitch black waters
no now i can tell you that wasn't here
before
i am pretty sure that that what that was
not i have cleaned out this drain a lot
of times as
miss please it is it's like an eldritch
purple glow you you know you know the
eldritch purple
right you know the eldritch purple it's
glow in the eldritch purple in
a intricate star-like pattern
yeah it means it's pretty it's quite
pretty you know it's
just you look at me like nice

but it does look like it is stopping
any water from from draining out yeah
i'll fish uh sort of a little a little
tape based dictophone out of my pocket
click the record button and go
uh health inspectors log health date
wednesday
it appears but there's some sort of
glowing foreign object
blocking the drain that's causing the
flood so i'm going to attempt
to unblock it now and i'll i've got my
little grabber
okay poke it poke it into the water and
try and dislodge
the purple blockage okay well so as you
do
you feel like an ice cold shock like
halfway between ice and electricity sort
of jolt up your arm
could you make me a roll to see if you
drop your grabber
uh yes although i would say that i am
following all of the correct procedures
uh and regulations so
i would like to invoke bureaucrat
because i'm i'm very much just doing my
job
yeah all right
i'll roll like a two or something it
won't matter oh oh actually
it didn't matter in the other way i
rolled a nine hey yeah you you pull it
back
whatever's whatever's blocking it it
doesn't appear to be
a physical object a blockage appears to
be metaphysical
um i'm not really sure if the manual has
any solutions for this uh
any ideas guys as you stare at it you
hear
a rushing of water from behind you and
you can you turn to see a figure
approaching oh
he knows mr calcifer is he walking on
the water no like it's like the water is
sort of
buoying up beneath him and like moving
him along
sort of babadooking on the water yeah
he's he's babadooking along the water
uh he's got the arms down in like the
the babadook pose
see that means nothing to me because
i've never seen it but i'm imagining the
gentleman from buffy
it just feels very anime to me i haven't
seen oh do you think
i'll throw you in the abyss and me and
we'll finish this episode ourselves
yes jonathan okay i mean let's be honest
that is that is
where the effort this is okay there's a
non-zero chance that it's gonna happen
let's see what's the word that's where
the momentum of the plot is
well currently the momentum of mr kelser
is headed straight towards us
straight towards uh you lid straight
towards freddie
uh oh mr mr calcifer sir um i i
just i i never doubted that you would
turn up and you would fix this
could you possibly explain to this
health and safety man
exactly how this is healthy and safe
because um it's not that i ever doubted
you but it is a little confusing to me
in my untrained
state i i am very happy to
uh listen to uh and help with the
assistance of the
uh the the the fixing of the drains so
this healthy safe
certainly certainly freddie i will
explain
i will explain you see
darkness and the abyss is the healthy
state of existence
and life is a blight oh so
freddie frost very much made a pact with
the dark powers to help
cure that blight from at the very least
dorset
maybe the rest of the world i have big
dreams but you've got to start somewhere
you did always say to me to watch how i
was going
because it would lead to strange things
yes okay
does that mean that there is no way to
stop the
this uh flood from taking over say the
world
ultimately now i'll be honest i didn't
expect it to happen quite so quickly
i had i had a lot of more preparations
to do but you work with what you have
so welcome to the future of the flooded
world
so is that it sounds like it's not
completely finished then no it's fine mr
kalsapur sir is there
it's oh okay so what what is it i could
uh freddie frowns and then
smiles and then frowns again i could
help you
with whatever is not quite finished
or vulnerable yes yes mr calcifer let us
help you
okay make me a roll and i will i'll give
you i'll give you a bonus
for dedicated because you have you have
always served mr casper very well
dedicated earnest himbo oh
someone rolled a nine oh that's nice
okay mr casper stops for a second and
sort of steeples his fingers
you wish to help me freddie oh yes mr
calcifer sir i would be extremely
very well but first i will require
proof of your dedication freddie
looks confused looks down at his hands
he's holding a baby in one and a whistle
and the other
looks very pain know the health
inspector throw the health inspector
into the into the abyss
or really rather you didn't because he's
he's the one that hasn't
i mean he hasn't offered to pledge his
loyalty to me so i feel that that's
probably a fair test
of your oil hang on a minute notes
to be quite honest um if if the options
are help you or the unending
freezing abyss uh i will help you uh i
do like an authority figure
and uh well hey if you want to be my new
head office then
go right ahead freddie continues his
pain the expression and then with a
look of resolution hands his whistle
to mr council says mrs pledge
okay the sign of his employee
as you know it's the employee language
this is a gesture
makes me think that you're quitting no
no no no the the the opposite
i feel like we're getting crosstalk here
yes sorry are we are we still going
to throw me in the abyss i am prepared
to pledge
yeah okay so so the thing is if if
you're all
on team calcifer yeah
absolutely then we can just sort of
kick back in my office and let the world
flood oh i thought
oh there's not there's i thought you
said that there was a problem so
yeah obviously maybe obviously the
encounter obviously this with the
ceiling condition isn't fully
finished yet but fundamentally if you're
if you're not really opposing me
then it it'll work anyway well that's
that's very true but i have been looking
at the rate of flow and the uh you know
sort of the
the speed of the expansion longer well
the longer it takes the uh the more time
there's some sort of eldritch task force
can be assembled to stop your plan so um
i reckon we should really
i oh yes i think i think look tell you
i'm from a government body and
uh well let me tell you the amount of
correspondence we get from the eldritch
task force uh trying to get us to shut
down spooky swimming pools is
is incredible really honestly that won't
shut up yes honestly it seems
i suppose i didn't really look into it
much before before i
start oh so you think you're the only
game in town here sir
well let me tell you no no no we've
worked they have shut down
tens hundreds even of uh well from small
time to big time eldritch crooks
oh it's an apocalypse a minute mr casper
we must
fix this immediately come on let's go
take us to your unfinished
thing okay so it's not i mean the
unfinished like i mean that's
he sort of points towards the the seal
that's the bit that's unfinished because
once it's finished the flood will will
the rate will will increase
so so if we we need to go back to our
off to my office
and then there are a few more sacrifices
oh i say so so mr calcifer so what
what what theoretically could break it
because then now can you see now it's
see
now it sounds like you're trying to
trick me into
into oh
huge eyes like the most dedicated
earnest okay look here's the the deal
if you genuinely want to help me grab a
few of those children on rings
bring them up to my office and we'll
we'll do the ritual finish it all off
don't worry the children will be fine
until we throw them back out into the
abyss
it's just a little it's just a it's just
a blood thing you you know just eldritch
it's fine or if you don't want to i'm
going to assume that you're still trying
to stop me
and we're going to obviously
miss pledge would like to just attack mr
calcifer
she's decided freddie is in danger
she knows freddie freddie's just saved a
baby freddie isn't going to go along
with this again miss pleasure okay i
will say he is completely unprepared
because he's very much he's got he's
really got into his own head about this
like
she's gonna leap on him screaming
paddle freddy go boy
okay i'm gonna ask um uh roll oh you'll
need an eight i don't
think you have anything that's going to
help you here i'm very
loyal and resourceful and old as balls
i don't know if any of those friends are
going to like assist you with
you don't sleep as balls without
fighting skills this is
true especially in dorset
i'm from dorset and you do you do
a lot of people there are old i got a
ton
hey okay oh my gosh you're in your
flamingo
yes uh you leap off your flamingo
and sort of like just kind of tackle uh
mr calcifer
you hit him square in the center of the
torso and he sort of topples backwards
like a tree
and he is now like prone he is on top of
the water the water is not
he's not sort of absorbing him but he is
he's lying there he's he's
trying to fight you off but he's he's
very scrawny
actually can freddie in a
fit of anguished twisted broken loyalty
uh start
whacking uh mr casper in the head with
the power i'm so glad you said father
it's so uh i just i
don't know what this is yeah i mean he's
being
he's being held down by an old cleaner
so
i'll say you just need a six okay cool
yeah i'm i'm
i'm gonna hope that the baby is old
enough to deal with kind of the fact
that
he's sort of tucked under an arm while
the other arm is whacking mr kelsey
in the head it's a very strong arm yes
yeah this baby has been super chill so
far
baby really ch chill baby i mean i'm
guessing that is at least
a bit of the dark
you've kind of got him i mean obviously
not exactly where you want him because
ideally you wouldn't want him like
floating on top of the void but he's
being hit in the head
he's being pinned by a tiny angry
cleaner uh ben
what's uh what's what's gavin crumble
doing well
okay so given that like i was also gonna
try the old and knock him into the abyss
and watch him disappear and that hasn't
worked but he is
pretty thoroughly distracted so he's
mentioned the sort of ritual going on in
his office
so i'm gonna like quietly sort of just
paddle off
to his office because i've seen him
standing spookily at the balcony which
was his first mistake
for telling me where his office was and
yeah i'm going to try and break into his
office to disrupt whatever
okay you can paddle off to the office so
he's going to try and
shove you off of him lorraine okay
he's going to fail quite significantly
if you wanted to ah
i i guess can we tie him up somewhere
so that we can not really you don't have
the like the thing is
you don't really have any rope and b
like you can tie him up as much as you
could easily tie up a surfboard
while like on it in in the sea which is
in
my imagination not easily of course i
forgot
i was riding him essentially
no i think you're right and we've sorted
the drain really haven't we
i mean you haven't at all because it's
still sealed by an eldritch
uh symbol we tried poking it in anyway i
should throw him
into it i'm gonna try and get like so i
want to like paddle him
paddle him
his head breaks the spooky symbol
okay so you want to paddle mr calcifer
into the spooky symbol
towards the eldridge train okay i'll
i'll
should have made freddy full time months
ago
and you know it is the best thing about
this park you awful man
right that was mr casper's crime ben
yeah you were arrived at the office
kevin crumble is there it looks like a
very normal
bureaucratic office except for in the
middle
there is a small table which has an
ornate stone bowl full of utterly still
pitch-black water uh in the middle uh
and as a bureaucrat you know that's not
standard for an office
i would have more expected like a
newton's cradle or something yeah
something like that yeah hmm
i can't even think of a good one such a
nerd
yeah i'm gonna use my grabber and uh
that's actually pretty smart i was gonna
do you some damage yeah that's it i was
like oh spooky water
okay uh well looks like this needs to be
disposed of
in the appropriate manner and i'll pick
up the
the grabber like like with a sort of
smelting bowl sure and just
carefully carefully pour the water into
the waste paper bin right you're having
blue spooky water all right
i'll get you to do to give me a roll but
this is this is a very
bureaucratic you need a four just roll a
four
six six yeah okay away it goes okay as
that is being poured away
lowry uh you've paddled mister
yeah into this symbol
and it's it starts to like the the
purple eldritch light changes to a green
eldritch light then a red eldritch light
as things start to shudder and shake and
his body starts to be drawn downwards
telescoping out infinitely and curling
around
the infinite never-ending abyss you can
feel
yourself getting pulled down as well uh
freddy
do you want freddie reaches out a paddle
okay to
grab the paddle miss pledge thank you
freddie boy
right i'm gonna say that's gonna be an
eight to grab the paddle
do you have anything you think might
help um
no well i will i will put out there that
miss pledge did grew up on the gower
where the surf is really good so she can
handle a surfboard
even if it's twisting into the unknown
abyss
oh no i got a seven you got a seven
yeah well i'm afraid as you reach no
miss miss pledge freddie reaches and
screams and whistles at the same time
take care of the ball and his pledge
vanishes
i'll call the baby
yeah well i'll i'll tell you what
because because the seal was broken
freddie does remember miss pledge uh her
memory has not been wiped
oh that's cool yeah so you know the
water starts to drain away
the the land returns peace once again
reigns over slide world
and yeah freddie freddie can raise the
baby up and be like oh
i'll name you after the bravest person i
know ms pledge
to the people that were sunk in the
water not come back no that's
like a lot they're gone oh okay you got
a free baby so there's a lot of echo
freddie's a young single dad with no
joke do you want to do it do you want to
do a sort of
few years let's have an later
flash forward it's uh freddie
and gavin crumble uh are now presiding
over a small and reasonably successful
and very clean water park
with their small adopted child
the toilet bowl has been renamed the miz
pledge memorial
rotating descender
[Laughter]
there's a statue at the end uh well you
have the miss pledge memorial park
that's it that's the name all of the
riots are just named what they were
before but with the ms
memorial i like the miss pledge memorial
slide world we just couldn't
change the name of like it was actually
kind of a legal headache to try and
change it because there's no
branding stuff yeah yeah so of course
we've got the tank museum
monkey world and the miss pledge
memorial slide well yeah
you've just you've just you've just like
you've just put some balsa wood
over that corridor that led to the pump
uh the pump area and it's just you know
yeah we've hung an out-of-order sign on
the devil's uh
note that what was it called again
healthy how healthier
the hell fall has been out of order for
two years
but aside from that everything's fine
miss pledge
is is growing up as the as the light
dims
we we sort of see mispledge the
the now precocious and adventurous child
begin to leave her off the balls of wood
and from one of the drains just a small
bubble
of dark black water
the end
[Laughter]
