#### ARUN

> "-- turned from the bridegroom's door.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> He went like one that hath been stunned,
> 
> And is of sense forlorn:
> 
> A sadder and a wiser man,
> 
> He rose the morrow morn."[^1]

[^1]: *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,* by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

##### [EXHALE OF COMPLETION, ACCOMPANIED BY POLITE CLAPPING]

#### LAVERNE

Thank you, Arun. That was lovely.

#### CELIA

Hmmm.

#### ARUN

E-Everything alright, Celia? Not a fan of Coleridge?

#### UNNAMED

We have heard it a few times now.

#### ARUN

Yeah... well... the library is a touch limited down here.

#### LAVERNE

_[Playfully]_ You want to ask them to bring back something to read from up top? Like that 'magazine'?

##### [DISCOMFITED NOISES AS THEY REMEMBER THE 'MAGAZINE']

#### CELIA

_[Anxious]_ No, it's fine. I like the poem. I'm just... worried.

#### UNNAMED

They haven't been gone long.

#### ARUN

You know the path that they walk. No harm can come to them.

#### CELIA

I know, I just... I...

#### LAVERNE

What is it?

#### CELIA

I keep hearing things. Something's going on up there. And I don't like it.

#### UNNAMED

I've heard it too. The city's excited about something.

#### LAVERNE

Not just up there...

#### ARUN

Laverne?

#### LAVERNE

I, uh, I got a bit too close to the stairs yesterday. 

##### [ANXIOUS NOISES]

#### UNNAMED

_[Sharply]_ Seriously? Did they see you?

#### LAVERNE

No. But... there were more watchers.

#### CELIA

What do you mean 'more'? There's two. One each side.

#### LAVERNE

Not anymore. I didn't get a good look, but... there must have been about four or five.

#### UNNAMED

You think something's happening?

#### CELIA

I don't like it!

#### ARUN

Have faith! The prophets shall protect us.

#### UNNAMED

Like they protected Song and Christopher?

#### ARUN

That was our fault!

#### UNNAMED

Uh-huh!

#### ARUN

We became arrogant, attracted attention. They're the Chosen, they're not all-powerful.

#### CELIA

Whatever. I still don't like it, okay? I'm worried! Something's... coming. Something big. And I doubt it's friendly.

#### LAVERNE

Look at it this way. The world's already ended... how much worse can it be?
